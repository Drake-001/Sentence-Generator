INFERNO I


Midway in the journey of our life →

I came to myself in a dark wood, →

3

for the straight way was lost. →



Ah, how hard it is to tell

the nature of that wood, savage, dense and harsh—

6

the very thought of it renews my fear!



It is so bitter death is hardly more so. →

But to set forth the good I found →

9

I will recount the other things I saw.



How I came there I cannot really tell,

I was so full of sleep →

12

when I forsook the one true way.



But when I reached the foot of a hill, →

there where the valley ended →

15

that had pierced my heart with fear, →



looking up, I saw its shoulders

arrayed in the first light of the planet →

18

that leads men straight, no matter what their road. →



Then the fear that had endured

in the lake of my heart, all the night →

21

I spent in such distress, was calmed.



And as one who, with laboring breath, →

has escaped from the deep to the shore

24

turns and looks back at the perilous waters,



so my mind, still in flight,

turned back to look once more upon the pass →

27

no mortal being ever left alive.



After I rested my wearied flesh a while,

I took my way again along the desert slope,

30

my firm foot always lower than the other. →



But now, near the beginning of the steep,

a leopard light and swift →

33

and covered with a spotted pelt →



refused to back away from me

but so impeded, barred the way,

36

that many times I turned to go back down.



It was the hour of morning,

when the sun mounts with those stars →

39

that shone with it when God’s own love



first set in motion those fair things,

so that, despite that beast with gaudy fur,

42

I still could hope for good, encouraged



by the hour of the day and the sweet season,

only to be struck by fear

45

when I beheld a lion in my way.



He seemed about to pounce—

his head held high and furious with hunger—

48

so that the air appeared to tremble at him.



And then a she-wolf who, all hide and bones,

seemed charged with all the appetites

51

that have made many live in wretchedness



so weighed my spirits down with terror,

which welled up at the sight of her,

54

that I lost hope of making the ascent.



And like one who rejoices in his gains →

but when the time comes and he loses,

57

turns all his thought to sadness and lament,



such did the restless beast make me—

coming against me, step by step,

60

it drove me down to where the sun is silent.



While I was fleeing to a lower place, →

before my eyes a figure showed, →

63

faint, in the wide silence. →



When I saw him in that vast desert, →

‘Have mercy on me, whatever you are,’ →

66

I cried, ‘whether shade or living man!’



He answered: ’Not a man, though once I was. →

My parents were from Lombardy—

69

Mantua was their homeland.



‘I was born sub Julio, though late in his time, →

and lived at Rome, under good Augustus

72

in an age of false and lying gods.



‘I was a poet and I sang →

the just son of Anchises come from Troy →

75

after proud Ilium was put to flame. →



‘But you, why are you turning back to misery?

Why do you not climb the peak that gives delight, →

78

origin and cause of every joy?’



‘Are you then Virgil, the fountainhead →

that pours so full a stream of speech?’

81

I answered him, my head bent low in shame. →



‘O glory and light of all other poets,

let my long study and great love avail

84

that made me delve so deep into your volume. →



‘You are my teacher and my author.

You are the one from whom alone I took →

87

the noble style that has brought me honor.



‘See the beast that forced me to turn back.

Save me from her, famous sage—

90

she makes my veins and pulses tremble.’



‘It is another path that you must follow,’

he answered, when he saw me weeping,

93

‘if you would flee this wild and savage place.



‘For the beast that moves you to cry out

lets no man pass her way,

96

but so besets him that she slays him.



‘Her nature is so vicious and malign

her greedy appetite is never sated—

99

after she feeds she is hungrier than ever.



‘Many are the creatures that she mates with, →

and there will yet be more, until the hound

102

shall come who’ll make her die in pain.



‘He shall not feed on lands or lucre

but on wisdom, love, and power.

105

Between felt and felt shall be his birth.



‘He shall be the salvation of low-lying Italy, →

for which maiden Camilla, Euryalus, →

108

Turnus, and Nisus died of their wounds.



‘He shall hunt the beast through every town →

till he has sent her back to Hell

111

whence primal envy set her loose.



‘Therefore, for your sake, I think it wise

you follow me: I will be your guide,

114

leading you, from here, through an eternal place



‘where you shall hear despairing cries

and see those ancient souls in pain

117

as they bewail their second death. →



‘Then you shall see the ones who are content

to burn because they hope to come,

120

whenever it may be, among the blessed.



‘Should you desire to ascend to these,

you’ll find a soul more fit to lead than I: →

123

I’ll leave you in her care when I depart.



‘For the Emperor who has His seat on high

wills not, because I was a rebel to His law, →

126

that I should make my way into His city.



‘In every part He reigns and there He rules.

There is His city and His lofty seat.

129

Happy the one whom He elects to be there!’



And I answered: ‘Poet, I entreat you

by the God you did not know,

132

so that I may escape this harm and worse, →



‘lead me to the realms you’ve just described

that I may see Saint Peter’s gate →

and those you tell me are so sorrowful.’

136

Then he set out and I came on behind him.

INFERNO II


Day was departing and the darkened air →

released the creatures of the earth

3

from their labor, and I, alone, →



prepared to face the struggle— →

of the way and of the pity of it—

6

which memory, unerring, shall retrace. →



O Muses, O lofty genius, aid me now! →

O memory, that set down what I saw,

9

here shall your worth be shown.



I began: ‘Poet, you who guide me, →

consider if my powers will suffice

12

before you trust me to this arduous passage. →



‘You tell of the father of Sylvius; →

that he, still subject to corruption, went

15

to the eternal world while in the flesh. →



‘But that the adversary of all evil showed; →

such favor to him, considering who and what he was,

18

and the high sequel that would spring from him,



‘seems not unfitting to a man who understands. →

For in the Empyrean he was chosen

21

to father holy Rome and her dominion,



‘both of these established—if we would speak; →

the truth—to be the sacred precinct where

24

successors of great Peter have their throne.



‘On this journey, for which you grant him glory,

he heard the words that prompted him; →

27

to victory and prepared the Papal mantle. →



‘Later, the Chosen Vessel went there; →

to bring back confirmation of our faith,

30

the first step in our journey to salvation.



‘But why should I go there? who allows it?

I am not Aeneas, nor am I Paul. →

33

Neither I nor any think me fit for this. →



‘And so, if I commit myself to come,

I fear it may be madness. You are wise,

36

you understand what I cannot express.’



And as one who unwills what he has willed, →

changing his intent on second thought

39

so that he quite gives over what he has begun,



such a man was I on that dark slope.

With too much thinking I had undone; →

42

the enterprise so quick in its inception.



‘If I have rightly understood your words,’ →

replied the shade of that great soul,

45

‘your spirit is assailed by cowardice,



‘which many a time so weighs upon a man

it turns him back from noble enterprise,

48

the way a beast shies from a shadow. →



‘To free you from this fear

I’ll tell you why I came and what I heard

51

when first I felt compassion for you.



‘I was among the ones who are suspended; →

when a lady called me, so blessèd and so fair; →

54

that I implored her to command me.



‘Her eyes shone brighter than the stars.

Gentle and clear, the words she spoke to me— →

57

an angel’s voice was in her speech:



‘ “O courteous Mantuan spirit, →

whose fame continues in the world

60

and shall continue while the world endures,



‘ “my friend, who is no friend of Fortune, →

is so hindered on his way upon the desert slope; →

63

that, in his terror, he has turned back,



‘ “and, from what I hear of him in Heaven,

I fear he has gone so far astray

66

that I arose too late to help him.



‘ “Set out, and with your polished words; →

and whatever else is needed for his safety,

69

go to his aid, that I may be consoled.



‘ “I who bid you go am Beatrice.

I come from where I most desire to return.

72

The love that moved me makes me speak.



‘ “And when I am before my Lord

often will I offer praise of you to Him.” →

75

Then she fell silent. And I began:



‘ “O lady of such virtue that by it alone; →

the human race surpasses all that lies

78

within the smallest compass of the heavens,



‘ “so pleased am I at your command that my consent,

were it already given, would be given late.

81

You have but to make your desire known.



‘ “But tell me why you do not hesitate

to descend into the center of the earth; →

84

from the unbounded space you long for.”



‘ “Since you are so eager to know more,” →

she answered, “I shall be brief in telling you

87

why I am not afraid to enter here.



‘ “We should fear those things alone

that have the power to harm.

90

Nothing else is frightening.



‘ “I am made such by God’s grace

that your affliction does not touch,

93

nor can these fires assail me.



‘ “There is a gracious lady in Heaven so moved; →

by pity at his peril, she breaks stern judgment

96

there above and lets me send you to him.



‘ “She summoned Lucy and made this request: →

«Your faithful one is now in need of you

99

and I commend him to your care.»



‘ “Lucy, the enemy of every cruelty,

arose and came to where I sat

102

at venerable Rachel’s side, →



‘ “and said: «Beatrice, true praise of God,

why do you not help the one who loved you so

105

that for your sake he left the vulgar herd?; →



‘ “«Do you not hear the anguish in his tears?

Do you not see the death besetting him; →

108

on the swollen river where the sea cannot prevail?»



‘ “Never were men on earth so swift to seek; →

their good or to escape their harm as I,

111

after these words were spoken,



‘ “to descend here from my blessèd seat,

trusting to the noble speech that honors you

114

and those who have paid it heed.”



‘After she had said these things to me,

she turned away her eyes, now bright with tears, →

117

making me more eager to set out.



‘And so I came to you just as she wished. →

I saved you from the beast denying you

120

the short way to the mountain of delight.



‘What then? Why, why do you delay?

Why do you let such cowardice rule your heart?

123

Why are you not more spirited and sure,



‘when three such blessèd ladies

care for you in Heaven’s court

126

and my words promise so much good?’



As little flowers, bent and closed

with chill of night, when the sun

129

lights them, stand all open on their stems,



such, in my failing strength, did I become.

And so much courage poured into my heart

132

that I began, as one made resolute:



‘O how compassionate was she to help me, →

how courteous were you, so ready to obey

135

the truthful words she spoke to you!



‘Your words have made my heart

so eager for the journey

138

that I’ve returned to my first intent.



‘Set out then, for one will prompts us both.

You are my leader, you my lord and master,’ →

I said to him, and when he moved ahead

142

I entered on the deep and savage way. →

INFERNO III


THROUGH ME THE WAY TO THE CITY OF WOE, →

THROUGH ME THE WAY TO EVERLASTING PAIN,

3

THROUGH ME THE WAY AMONG THE LOST. →



JUSTICE MOVED MY MAKER ON HIGH. →

DIVINE POWER MADE ME, →

6

WISDOM SUPREME, AND PRIMAL LOVE.



BEFORE ME NOTHING WAS BUT THINGS ETERNAL, →

AND ETERNAL, I ENDURE.

9

ABANDON ALL HOPE, YOU WHO ENTER HERE.



These words, dark in hue, I saw inscribed →

over an archway. And then I said:

12

‘Master, for me their meaning is hard.’ →



And he, as one who understood: →

‘Here you must banish all distrust,

15

here must all cowardice be slain.



‘We have come to where I said

you would see the miserable sinners

18

who have lost the good of the intellect.’ →



And after he had put his hand on mine

with a reassuring look that gave me comfort,

21

he led me toward things unknown to man. →



Now sighs, loud wailing, lamentation →

resounded through the starless air,

24

so that I too began to weep. →



Unfamiliar tongues, horrendous accents, →

words of suffering, cries of rage, voices

27

loud and faint, the sound of slapping hands— →



all these made a tumult, always whirling

in that black and timeless air,

30

as sand is swirled in a whirlwind.



And I, my head encircled by error, said:

‘Master, what is this I hear, and what people

33

are these so overcome by pain?’



And he to me: ‘This miserable state is borne →

by the wretched souls of those who lived

36

without disgrace yet without praise.



‘They intermingle with that wicked band →

of angels, not rebellious and not faithful

39

to God, who held themselves apart.



‘Loath to impair its beauty, Heaven casts them out, →

and depth of Hell does not receive them

42

lest on their account the evil angels gloat.’



And I: ‘Master, what is so grievous to them,

that they lament so bitterly?’

45

He replied: ‘I can tell you in few words.



‘They have no hope of death, →

and their blind life is so abject

48

that they are envious of every other lot.



‘The world does not permit report of them.

Mercy and justice hold them in contempt. →

51

Let us not speak of them—look and pass by.’



And I, all eyes, saw a whirling banner →

that ran so fast it seemed as though

54

it never could find rest.



Behind it came so long a file of people

that I could not believe

57

death had undone so many.



After I recognized a few of these, →

I saw and knew the shade of him

60

who, through cowardice, made the great refusal.



At once with certainty I understood

this was that worthless crew

63

hateful alike to God and to His foes.



These wretches, who never were alive, →

were naked and beset

66

by stinging flies and wasps



that made their faces stream with blood,

which, mingled with their tears,

69

was gathered at their feet by loathsome worms.



And then, fixing my gaze farther on, →

I saw souls standing on the shore of a wide river,

72

and so I said: ‘Master, permit me first



‘to know who they are and then what inner law

makes them so eager for the crossing,

75

or so they seem in this dim light.’ →



And he to me: ‘You shall know these things, →

but not before we stay our steps

78

on the mournful shore of Acheron.’



Then, my eyes cast down with shame,

fearing my words displeased him,

81

I did not speak until we reached that stream.



And now, coming toward us in a boat,

an old man, his hair white with age, cried out:

84

‘Woe unto you, you wicked souls,



‘give up all hope of ever seeing Heaven.

I come to take you to the other shore,

87

into eternal darkness, into heat and chill.



‘And you there, you living soul, →

move aside from these now dead.’

90

But when he saw I did not move,



he said: ‘By another way, another port, →

not here, you’ll come to shore and cross.

93

A lighter ship must carry you.’



And my leader: ‘Charon, do not torment yourself. →

It is so willed where will and power are one, →

96

and ask no more.’



That stilled the shaggy jowls

of the pilot of the livid marsh,

99

about whose eyes burned wheels of flame.



But those souls, naked and desolate,

lost their color. With chattering teeth

102

they heard his brutal words.



They blasphemed God, their parents,

the human race, the place, the time, the seed →

105

of their begetting and their birth.



Then, weeping bitterly, they drew together

to the accursèd shore that waits

108

for everyone who fears not God.



Charon the demon, with eyes of glowing coals, →

beckons to them, herds them all aboard,

111

striking anyone who slackens with his oar. →



Just as in autumn the leaves fall away, →

one, and then another, until the bough

114

sees all its spoil upon the ground,



so the wicked seed of Adam fling themselves

one by one from shore, at his signal,

117

as does a falcon at its summons.



Thus they depart over dark water,

and before they have landed on the other side

120

another crowd has gathered on this shore.



‘My son,’ said the courteous master,

‘all those who die in the wrath of God

123

assemble here from every land.



‘And they are eager to cross the river,

for the justice of God so spurs them on →

126

their very fear is turned to longing.



‘No good soul ever crosses at this place.

Thus, if Charon complains on your account,

129

now you can grasp the meaning of his words.’



When he had ended, the gloomy plain shook →

with such force, the memory of my terror

132

makes me again break out in sweat.



From the weeping ground there sprang a wind,

flaming with vermilion light,

which overmastered all my senses,

136

and I dropped like a man pulled down by sleep. →

Virgil is eager for Dante’s questions about those who dwell in Limbo, sinless, but without faith

43–45

Dante grieves, realizing many good people are here

46–50

Dante: has anyone gone from Limbo to heaven?

51–63

Virgil describes the harrowing of hell, which he saw

64–72

the lightest place in hell: honorable souls

73–75

Dante: why are these set apart in the light?

76–78

the poet insists on his inability to give a full account

148–151

Virgil and Dante move on to less peaceful precincts





INFERNO IV


A heavy thunderclap broke my deep sleep →

so that I started up like one

3

shaken awake by force.



With rested eyes, I stood

and looked about me, then fixed my gaze

6

to make out where I was.



I found myself upon the brink

of an abyss of suffering

9

filled with the roar of endless woe.



It was full of vapor, dark and deep.

Straining my eyes toward the bottom,

12

I could see nothing.



‘Now let us descend into the blind world →

down there,’ began the poet, gone pale.

15

‘I will be first and you come after.’



And I, noting his pallor, said: →

‘How shall I come if you’re afraid,

18

you, who give me comfort when I falter?’ →



And he to me: ‘The anguish of the souls →

below us paints my face

21

with pity you mistake for fear.



‘Let us go, for the long road calls us.’

Thus he went first and had me enter

24

the first circle girding the abyss.



Here, as far as I could tell by listening, →

was no lamentation other than the sighs

27

that kept the air forever trembling.



These came from grief without torment

borne by vast crowds

30

of men, and women, and little children. →



My master began: ‘You do not ask about

the souls you see? I want you to know,

33

before you venture farther,



‘they did not sin. Though they have merit,

that is not enough, for they were unbaptized,

36

denied the gateway to the faith that you profess.



‘And if they lived before the Christians lived,

they did not worship God aright.

39

And among these I am one.



‘For such defects, and for no other fault,

we are lost, and afflicted but in this,

42

that without hope we live in longing.’ →



When I understood, great sadness seized my heart,

for then I knew that beings of great worth →

45

were here suspended in this Limbo. →



‘Tell me, master, tell me, sir,’ I began, →

seeking assurance in the faith

48

that conquers every doubt,



‘did ever anyone, either by his own

or by another’s merit, go forth from here

51

and rise to blessedness?’



And he, who understood my covert speech: →

‘I was new to this condition when I saw

54

a mighty one descend, crowned, with the sign of victory.



‘Out of our midst he plucked the shade →

of our first parent, of Abel his son, of Noah,

57

and of Moses, obedient in giving laws,



‘the patriarch Abraham, David the King,

Israel with his father and his sons,

60

and with Rachel, for whom he served so long,



‘as well as many others, and he made them blessed.

And, I would have you know, before these →

63

no human souls were saved.’



We did not halt our movement as he spoke,

but all the while were passing through a wood—

66

I mean a wood of thronging spirits.



We had not yet gone far from where I’d slept

when I beheld a blaze of light

69

that overcame a hemisphere of darkness,



though still a good way from it,

yet not so far but I discerned

72

an honorable company was gathered there. →



‘O you who honor art and knowledge, →

why are these so honored they are set

75

apart from the condition of the rest?’



And he answered: ‘Their honorable fame,

which echoes in your life above,

78

gains favor in Heaven, which thus advances them.’ →



Just then I heard a voice that said: →

‘Honor the loftiest of poets! →

81

His shade returns that had gone forth.’



When the voice had paused and there was silence,

I saw four worthy shades approach,

84

their countenances neither sad nor joyful.



The good master spoke: ‘Take note

of him who holds that sword in hand →

87

and comes as lord before the three:



‘He is Homer, sovereign poet. → →

Next comes Horace the satirist, →

90

Ovid is third, the last is Lucan. →



‘Since each is joined to me

in the name the one voice uttered,

93

they do me honor and, doing so, do well.’ →



There I saw assembled the fair school

of the lord of loftiest song, →

96

soaring like an eagle far above the rest.



After they conversed a while,

they turned to me with signs of greeting,

99

and my master smiled at this. →



And then they showed me greater honor still,

for they made me one of their company, →

102

so that I became the sixth amidst such wisdom. →



Thus we went onward to the light,

speaking of things that here are best unsaid, →

105

just as there it was fitting to express them.



We came to the foot of a noble castle, →

encircled seven times by towering walls,

108

defended round about by a fair stream.



Over this stream we moved as on dry land.

Through seven gates I entered with these sages

111

until we came to a fresh, green meadow.



People were there with grave, slow-moving eyes

and visages of great authority.

114

They seldom spoke, and then in gentle tones.



When we withdrew over to one side →

into an open space, high in the light,

117

we could observe them all.



There before me on the enameled green

the great spirits were revealed.

120

In my heart I exult at what I saw.



I saw Electra with many of her line, →

of whom I recognized Hector, Aeneas,

123

and Caesar, in arms, with his falcon eyes. →



I saw Camilla and Penthesilea. →

Seated apart I saw King Latinus,

126

and next to him Lavinia, his daughter.



I saw that Brutus who drove out Tarquinius, →

Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia.

129

And Saladin I saw, alone, apart. →



When I raised my eyes a little higher,

I saw the master of those who know, →

132

sitting among his philosophic kindred.



Eyes trained on him, all show him honor.

In front of all the rest and nearest him →

135

I saw Socrates and Plato.



I saw Democritus, who ascribes the world

to chance, Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,

138

Empedocles, Heraclitus, and Zeno.



I saw the skilled collector of the qualities →

of things—I mean Dioscorides—and I saw

141

Orpheus, Cicero, Linus, and moral Seneca,



Euclid the geometer, and Ptolemy, →

Hippocrates, Avicenna, Galen,

144

and Averroes, who wrote the weighty glosses.



I cannot give account of all of them, →

for the length of my theme so drives me on

147

that often the telling comes short of the fact.



The company of six falls off to two

and my wise leader brings me by another way

out of the still, into the trembling, air.

151

And I come to a place where nothing shines.





OUTLINE: INFERNO V


1–3

descent to the second Circle: the lustful

4–15

proem: Minos judge of the damned

16–20

Minos attempts to discourage Dante

21–24

Virgil repeats his magical phrase (III.95–96)

25–30

again, impressions of sound are the first Dante has

31–39

the “hellscape”: weeping, darkness, storm

40–49

two similes: starlings and cranes

50–51

Dante wants to know who are punished here; Virgil:

52–63

Semiramis, Dido, Cleopatra

64–69

Helen, Achilles, Paris, Tristan, and many others

70–78

Dante’s piteous reaction and desire to speak

79–81

he calls out to the pair of lovers

82–87

simile: doves returning to nest

88–108

Francesca’s first speech:

88–96

her kind words for Dante’s kindness

97–99

she is from Ravenna

100–108

Love … Love … Love…: her litany of joy, woe



109–111

Dante’s reaction and Virgil’s laconic question

112–120

Dante’s rumination and question to Francesca

121–138

Francesca’s second response:

121–126

despite the pain it will cause, she will speak

127–129

she and Paolo were reading of Lancelot in love

130–138

enflamed by the reading, they embraced



139–142

coda: Francesca concludes, Paolo weeps, Dante faints





INFERNO V


Thus I descended from the first circle →

down into the second, which girds a smaller space

3

but greater agony to goad lament.



There stands Minos, snarling, terrible. →

He examines each offender at the entrance,

6

judges and dispatches as he encoils himself. →



I mean that when the ill-begotten soul →

stands there before him it confesses all, →

9

and that accomplished judge of sins →



decides what place in Hell is fit for it,

then coils his tail around himself to count

12

how many circles down the soul must go.



Always before him stands a crowd of them,

going to judgment each in turn.

15

They tell, they hear, and then are hurled down.



‘O you who come to this abode of pain,’

said Minos when he saw me, pausing →

18

in the exercise of his high office, →



‘beware how you come in and whom you trust.

Don’t let the easy entrance fool you. →

21

And my leader to him: ‘Why all this shouting?



‘Hinder not his destined journey. →

It is so willed where will and power are one,

24

and ask no more.’



Now I can hear the screams →

of agony. Now I have come →

27

where a great wailing beats upon me.



I reached a place mute of all light,

which bellows as the sea in tempest

30

tossed by conflicting winds.



The hellish squall, which never rests,

sweeps spirits in its headlong rush,

33

tormenting, whirls and strikes them.



Caught in that path of violence, →

they shriek, weep, and lament.

36

Then how they curse the power of God!



I understood that to such torment

the carnal sinners are condemned,

39

they who make reason subject to desire.



As, in cold weather, the wings of starlings → →

bear them up in wide, dense flocks,

42

so does that blast propel the wicked spirits.



Here and there, down and up, it drives them.

Never are they comforted by hope

45

of rest or even lesser punishment.



Just as cranes chant their mournful songs, →

making a long line in the air,

48

thus I saw approach, heaving plaintive sighs,



shades lifted on that turbulence,

so that I said: ‘Master, who are these

51

whom the black air lashes?’



‘The first of them about whom

you would hear,’ he then replied,

54

‘was empress over many tongues.



‘She was so given to the vice of lechery

she made lust licit in her law

57

to take away the blame she had incurred.



‘She is Semiramis, of whom we read → →

that she, once Ninus’ wife, succeeded him.

60

She held sway in the land the Sultan rules.



‘Here is she who broke faith with the ashes → →

of Sichaeus and slew herself for love. →

63

The next is wanton Cleopatra. →



‘See Helen, for whose sake so many years

of ill rolled past. And see the great Achilles, →

66

who battled, at the last, with love.



‘See Paris, Tristan,’ and he showed me more

than a thousand shades, naming as he pointed,

69

whom love had parted from our life. →



When I heard my teacher name the ladies

and the knights of old, pity overcame me →

72

and I almost lost my senses.



I began: ‘Poet, gladly would I speak

with these two that move together →

75

and seem to be so light upon the wind.’



And he: ‘Once they are nearer, you will see: →

if you entreat them by the love

78

that leads them, they will come.’



As soon as the wind had bent them to us,

I raised my voice: ‘O wearied souls, →

81

if it is not forbidden, come speak with us.’



As doves, summoned by desire, their wings →

outstretched and motionless, move on the air,

84

borne by their will to the sweet nest,



so did these leave the troop where Dido is,

coming to us through the malignant air,

87

such force had my affectionate call.



‘O living creature, gracious and kind, →

that come through somber air to visit us

90

who stained the world with blood,



‘if the King of the universe were our friend → →

we would pray that He might give you peace,

93

since you show pity for our grievous plight.



‘We long to hear and speak of that

which you desire to speak and know,

96

here, while the wind has calmed.



‘On that shore where the river Po

with all its tributaries slows

99

to peaceful flow, there I was born.



‘Love, quick to kindle in the gentle heart, →

seized this man with the fair form taken from me.

102

The way of it afflicts me still. →



‘Love, which absolves no one beloved from loving, →

seized me so strongly with his charm that,

105

as you see, it has not left me yet.



‘Love brought us to one death.

Caïna waits for him who quenched our lives. →

108

These words were borne from them to us.



And when I’d heard those two afflicted souls →

I bowed my head and held it low until at last

111

the poet said: ‘What are your thoughts?’



In answer I replied: ‘Oh,

how many sweet thoughts, what great desire,

114

have brought them to this woeful pass!’



Then I turned to them again to speak

and I began: ‘Francesca, your torments

117

make me weep for grief and pity,



‘but tell me, in that season of sweet sighs, →

how and by what signs did Love

120

acquaint you with your hesitant desires?’



And she to me: ‘There is no greater sorrow →

than to recall our time of joy

123

in wretchedness—and this your teacher knows. →



‘But if you feel such longing

to know the first root of our love,

126

I shall tell as one who weeps in telling.



‘One day, to pass the time in pleasure, →

we read of Lancelot, how love enthralled him.

129

We were alone, without the least misgiving.



‘More than once that reading made our eyes meet

and drained the color from our faces.

132

Still, it was a single instant overcame us: →



‘When we read how the longed-for smile

was kissed by so renowned a lover, this man,

135

who never shall be parted from me,



‘all trembling, kissed me on my mouth.

A Galeotto was the book and he that wrote it. →

138

That day we read in it no further.’ →



While the one spirit said this

the other wept, so that for pity →

I swooned as if in death. →

142

And down I fell as a dead body falls. →





OUTLINE: INFERNO VI

91–93

he returns to his hebetude

94–99

Virgil: he will wake no more until the last trumpet

100–111

Virgil on the increase of eternal pain for the damned

112–115

they talk until they are ready to descend: Plutus





INFERNO VI


With my returning senses that had failed →

at the piteous state of those two kindred, →

3

which had confounded me with grief,



new torments and new souls in torment

I see about me, wherever I may move,

6

or turn, or set my gaze.



I am in the third circle, of eternal, →

hateful rain, cold and leaden,

9

changeless in its monotony.



Heavy hailstones, filthy water, and snow

pour down through gloomy air.

12

The ground it falls on reeks.



Cerberus, fierce and monstrous beast, →

barks from three gullets like a dog

15

over the people underneath that muck.



His eyes are red, his beard a greasy black,

his belly swollen. With his taloned hands

18

he claws the spirits, flays and quarters them.



The rain makes them howl like dogs.

The unholy wretches often turn their bodies,

21

making of one side a shield for the other.



When Cerberus—that huge worm—noticed us,

he opened up his jaws and showed his fangs.

24

There was no part of him he held in check.



But then my leader spread his hands, →

picked up some earth, and with full fists

27

tossed soil into the ravenous gullets.



As the dog that yelps with craving →

grows quiet while it chews its food,

30

absorbed in trying to devour it,



the foul heads of that demon Cerberus were stilled,

who otherwise so thunders on the souls

33

they would as soon be deaf.



We were passing over shades sprawled →

under heavy rain, setting our feet

36

upon their emptiness, which seems real bodies.



All of them were lying on the ground, →

except for one who sat bolt upright

39

when he saw us pass before him.



‘O you who come escorted through this Hell,’

he said, ‘if you can, bring me back to mind.

42

You were made before I was undone.’



And I to him: ‘The punishment you suffer →

may be blotting you from memory:

45

it doesn’t seem to me I’ve ever seen you.



‘But tell me who you are to have been put

into this misery with such a penalty

48

that none, though harsher, is more loathsome.’



And he to me: ‘Your city, so full of envy →

that now the sack spills over,

51

held me in its confines in the sunlit life.



‘You and my townsmen called me Ciacco. →

For the pernicious fault of gluttony,

54

as you can see, I’m prostrate in this rain.



‘And in my misery I am not alone.

All those here share a single penalty

57

for the same fault.’ He said no more.



I answered him: ‘Ciacco, your distress so weighs

on me it bids me weep. But tell me,

60

if you can, what shall be the fate



‘of the citizens within the riven city?

Are any in it just? And tell me why

63

such discord has assailed it.’



And he to me: ‘After long feuding →

they shall come to blood. The rustic faction,

66

having done great harm, shall drive the others out.



‘But it in turn must fall to them, →

within three years, by power of him

69

who now just bides his time.



‘These in their arrogance will long subject

the other faction to their heavy yoke,

72

despite its weeping and its shame.



‘Two men are just and are not heeded there. →

Pride, envy, and avarice are the sparks →

75

that have set the hearts of all on fire.’



With that he ended his distressing words.

And I to him: ‘I wish you would instruct me more,

78

granting me the gift of further speech.



‘Farinata and Tegghiaio, who were so worthy, →

Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,

81

and the rest whose minds were bent on doing good,



‘tell me where they are and how they fare.

For great desire presses me to learn

84

whether Heaven sweetens or Hell embitters them.’



And he: ‘They are among the blacker souls.

Different vices weigh them toward the bottom,

87

as you shall see if you descend that far.



‘But when you have returned to the sweet world →

I pray you bring me to men’s memory.

90

I say no more nor answer you again.’ →



With that his clear eyes lost their focus. →

He gazed at me until his head drooped down.

93

Then he fell back among his blind companions.



And my leader said: ‘He wakes no more

until angelic trumpets sound

96

the advent of the hostile Power.



‘Then each shall find again his miserable tomb,

shall take again his flesh and form,

99

and hear the judgment that eternally resounds.’ →



So we passed on through the foul mix

of shades and rain with lagging steps,

102

touching a little on the life to come. →



‘Master,’ I asked, ‘after the great Judgment

will these torments be greater, less,

105

or will they stay as harsh as they are now?’



And he replied: ‘Return to your science, →

which has it that, in measure of a thing’s perfection,

108

it feels both more of pleasure and of pain.



‘Although these accursèd people →

will never come to true perfection,

111

they will be nearer it than they are now.’



We went along that curving road,

with much more talk than I repeat,

and reached the point of our descent.

115

And there we came on Plutus, our great foe.





OUTLINE: INFERNO VII


1–15

proem: Plutus speaks; Virgil answers; Plutus collapses

16–21

the fourth Circle and Dante’s apostrophe of Justice

22–24

simile: waves meeting between Charybdis and Scylla

25–35

the avaricious and prodigal at their “jousts”

36–96

three exchanges between Dante & Virgil:

36–39

Dante: are the tonsured ones all clerics?

40–48

Virgil’s response is affirmative

49–51

Dante expects to recognize the sinners here

52–66

Virgil: no, their sin makes them indistinguishable

67–69

Dante: what is the “Fortune” of which you speak?

70–96

Virgil’s pronouncements on the role of Fortune



97–99

Virgil prepares Dante for descent to the fifth Circle

100–108

their descent, following its source, to Styx

109–116

the bog, with the wrathful in conflict with one another

117–126

and those below the water, sighing and gurgling

127–130

coda: retrospect over Styx, prospect of tower





INFERNO VII


‘Pape Satàn, Pape Satàn, aleppe!’ →

burst out Plutus in his raucous voice.

3

And the courteous, all-discerning sage,



to comfort me, said: ‘Do not be overcome

by fear. However powerful he may be,

6

he’ll not prevent our climbing down this cliff.’



Then he turned to that bloated face

and said: ‘Silence, accursèd wolf! →

9

Let your fury feed itself inside you.



‘Not without sanction is this journey down the pit. →

It is willed on high, where Michael

12

did avenge the proud rebellion.’



As sails, swollen by the wind, →

fall in a tangle when the mainmast snaps,

15

so fell that cruel beast to the ground.



Into the fourth hollow we made our way,

descending the dismal slope

18

that crams in all the evil of the universe.



Ah, Justice of God, who heaps up →

such strange punishment and pain as I saw there?

21

And why do our sins so waste us?



Just as the waves clash above Charybdis, →

one breaking on the other when they meet,

24

so here the souls move in their necessary dance. →



Here the sinners were more numerous than elsewhere, →

and they, with great shouts, from opposite sides

27

were shoving burdens forward with their chests.



They crashed into each other, turned

and beat retreat, shoving their loads and shouting:

30

‘Why do you hoard?’ or ‘Why do you squander?’



Thus they proceeded in their dismal round →

on both sides toward the opposite point,

33

taunting each other with the same refrain.



Once at that point, each group turned back

along its semi-circle to the next encounter.

36

And I, my heart pierced almost through, →



said: ‘Master, now explain to me

who these people are. Were those with tonsured heads, →

39

the ones there to our left, all clerics?’



‘All of them had such squinting minds

in their first lives,’ he said,

42

‘they kept no measure in their spending.



‘Their voices howl this clear enough

just as they reach the twin points on the circle

45

where opposing sins divide them.



‘These were clerics who have no lid of hair →

upon their heads, and popes and cardinals,

48

in whom avarice achieves its excess.’



And I: ‘Master, in such a crew as this

I ought to recognize at least a few

51

who were befouled with these offenses.’



And he to me: ‘You muster an empty thought.

The undiscerning life that made them foul

54

now makes them hard to recognize.



‘The two groups will collide forever.

These will rise from the grave

57

with fists tight, these with hair cropped. →



‘Ill-giving and ill-keeping have stolen

the fair world from them and set them to this scuffle.

60

As for that, I prettify no words for it.



‘Now you see, my son, what brief mockery

Fortune makes of goods we trust her with, →

63

for which the race of men embroil themselves.



‘All the gold that lies beneath the moon,

or ever did, could never give a moment’s rest

66

to any of these wearied souls.’



‘Master,’ I said, ‘tell me more: this Fortune

whom you mention, who is she that holds

69

the world’s possessions tightly in her clutches?’



And he to me: ‘O foolish creatures, →

what great ignorance besets you!

72

I’ll have you feed upon my judgment of her:



‘He whose wisdom transcends all

made the heavens and gave them guides,

75

so that all parts reflect on every part



‘in equal distribution of the light. Just so,

He ordained for worldly splendors

78

a general minister and guide



‘who shifts those worthless goods, from time to time,

from race to race, from one blood to another

81

beyond the intervention of human wit.



‘One people comes to rule, another languishes,

in keeping with her judgment,

84

as secret as a serpent hidden in the grass. →



‘Your wisdom cannot stand against her.

She foresees, she judges, she maintains her reign,

87

as do the other heavenly powers. →



‘Her mutability admits no rest.

Necessity compels her to be swift,

90

and frequent are the changes in men’s state. →



‘She is reviled by the very ones

who most should praise her,

93

blaming and defaming her unjustly.



‘But she is blessed and does not hear them.

Happy with the other primal creatures,

96

she turns her sphere, rejoicing in her bliss.



‘Now we must descend to greater anguish.

For every star that rose when I set out →

99

is sinking now—we must not linger here.’



We crossed the circle to the other bank,

beside a spring that bubbles up and flows

102

into a channel it makes for itself.



The water was darker than the deepest purple.

Accompanied by its murky waves

105

we began our strange descent.



This dreary stream, once it has reached →

these malignant, ashen slopes,

108

drains out into the swamp called Styx.



And I, my gaze transfixed, could see →

people with angry faces in that bog,

111

naked, their bodies smeared with mud.



They struck each other with their hands,

their heads, their chests and feet,

114

and tore each other with their teeth.



The good master said: ‘Son, now you see

the souls of those whom anger overcame.

117

And I would have you know for certain



‘that plunged beneath these waters, →

as your eyes will tell you, are souls whose sighs

120

with bubbles make the water’s surface seethe.



‘Fixed in the slime they say: “We were sullen

in the sweet air that in the sun rejoices,

123

filled as we were with slothful fumes.



‘ “Now we are sullen in black mire.”

This hymn they gurgle in their gullets,

126

for they cannot get a word out whole.’



Thus we made our circle round that filthy bog,

keeping between the bank and swamp,

fixing our gaze on those who swallow mud.

130

And we came to the foot of a tower at last.

121–130

Virgil’s promise of aid from above





INFERNO VIII


To continue, let me say that long before →

we reached the foot of that high tower

3

our eyes had noted at its top



two flaming lights displayed up there →

to which another, so far off the eye

6

could hardly make it out, sent back a signal.



And turning to that sea of wisdom, I asked: →

‘What does this mean? And that other fire,

9

what does it answer? And who are they that made it?’



And he to me: ‘Over the filthy waves

you may already glimpse what is to come,

12

if the marsh-fumes do not hide it from you.’



Never did a bowstring loose an arrow

that whipped away more swiftly through the air

15

than, even as I watched, a skiff came skimming →



straight toward us on the water,

under the guidance of a single helmsman,

18

crying: ‘Now you are caught, damned spirit!’ →



‘Phlegyas, Phlegyas, this time you shout in vain,’ →

replied my lord: ‘You’ll not have us any longer →

21

than it takes to cross this bog.’



Like one who learns of a deceitful plot →

that has been hatched against him and begins to fret,

24

such was Phlegyas in his stifled wrath.



My leader stepped into the boat, →

and had me follow after.

27

And only then did it seem laden.



As soon as he and I were in the bark

the ancient prow moves off, cutting deeper

30

through the water than when it carries souls.



While we crossed the stagnant swamp →

one cloaked in mud rose up to say: →

33

‘Who are you that you come before your time?’



And I to him: ‘If I come, I do not stay.

But you, who are you, now become so foul?’

36

He answered: ‘As you can see, I am one who weeps.’



And I to him: ‘In weeping and in misery, →

accursèd spirit, may you stay.

39

I know you, for all your filth.’



When he stretched both his hands toward the boat, →

the wary master thrust him off, saying:

42

‘Away there with the other dogs!’



Then my master put his arms around my neck,

kissed my face and said: ‘Indignant soul,

45

blessed is she that bore you in her womb!



‘In the world this man was full of arrogance. →

Not one good deed adorns his memory.

48

That is why his shade is so enraged.



‘How many now above who think themselves

great kings will lie here in the mud, like swine,

51

leaving behind nothing but ill repute!’



And I: ‘Master, I would be most eager

to see him pushed deep down into this soup

54

before we leave the lake.’



And he to me: ‘Before the shore

comes into view you’ll have your satisfaction.

57

Your wish deserves to be fulfilled.’



Soon I watched him get so torn to pieces

by the muddy crew, I still give praise

60

and thanks to God for it.



All cried: ‘Get Filippo Argenti!’ →

And that spiteful Florentine spirit →

63

gnawed at himself with his own teeth. →



Of him I say no more. Then we moved on,

when such a sound of mourning struck my ears

66

I opened my eyes wide to look ahead.



The good master said: ‘Now, my son,

we approach the city known as Dis, →

69

with its vast army and its burdened citizens.’



And I: ‘Master, I can clearly see its mosques →

within the ramparts, glowing red

72

as if they’d just been taken from the fire.’



And he to me: ‘The eternal fire

that burns inside them here in nether Hell

75

makes them show red, as you can see.’



At last we reached the moats

dug deep around the dismal city.

78

Its walls seemed made of iron. →



Not until we’d made a wide approach

did we come to a place where the boatman bellowed:

81

‘Out with you here, this is the entrance.’ →



At the threshold I saw more than a thousand angels →

fallen from Heaven. Angrily they shouted:

84

‘Who is this, who is not dead,



‘yet passes through the kingdom of the dead?’

At this my prudent master made a sign

87

that he would speak with them apart.



Then they reined in their great disdain

enough to say: ‘You come—alone. Let him be gone,

90

who has so boldly made his way into this kingdom.



‘Let him retrace his reckless path alone—

let him see if he can, for you shall stay,

93

you who have led him through this gloomy realm.’



Reader, how could I not lose heart →

at the sound of these accursèd words?

96

I thought I would never make it back.



‘O my dear leader, who seven times and more →

have braced my confidence and rescued me

99

from the grave dangers that assailed me,



‘do not leave me,’ I cried, ‘helpless now!

If going farther is denied us,

102

let us at once retrace our steps.’



But the mentor who had brought me there replied:

‘Have no fear. None can prevent our passage, →

105

so great a power granted it to us.



‘Wait for me here. Comfort your weary spirit →

and feed it with good hope.

108

I will not forsake you in the nether world.’



He goes away and leaves me there,

my gentle father, and I remain in doubt,

111

‘yes’ and ‘no’ at war within my mind.



I could not hear what he proposed,

but it was not long he stayed with them

114

before they pushed and scrambled back inside.



Then our adversaries slammed shut the gates →

against my master, who, left outside,

117

came back to me with halting steps.



He had his eyes upon the ground, his brows

shorn of all confidence. Sighing, he muttered:

120

‘Who dares deny me access to the realm of pain?’



To me he said: ‘Be not dismayed →

at my vexation. In this contest I’ll prevail,

123

whatever they contrive to keep us out.



‘This insolence of theirs is nothing new:

they showed it once before, at another gate.

126

It still stands open without lock or bolt.



‘Over it you saw the deadly writing. →

Even now, making his unescorted way →

down through the circles, one descends

130

by whom the city shall be opened.’

coda: the rightward turn





INFERNO IX


The pallor cowardice painted on my face →

when I saw my leader turning back

3

made him hasten to compose his features.



He stopped, like a man intent on listening,

for the eye could not probe far

6

through that dim air and murky fog.



‘Yet we must win this fight,’ he began, →

‘or else.… Such help was promised us.

9

How long it seems to me till someone comes!’



I clearly saw that he had covered up →

his first words with the others that came after,

12

words so different in meaning.



Still, I was filled with fear by what he said.

Perhaps I understood his broken phrase

15

to hold worse meaning than it did.



‘Does ever anyone from the first circle,

where the only penalty is hope cut off, →

18

descend so deep into this dismal pit?’



I put this question and he answered: →

‘It seldom happens that a soul from Limbo

21

undertakes the journey I am on.



‘It is true I came here once before,

conjured by pitiless Erichtho,

24

who could call shades back into their bodies.



‘I had not long been naked of my flesh

when she compelled me to go inside this wall

27

to fetch a spirit from the circle of Judas. →



‘That is the lowest place, the darkest, →

and farthest from the heaven that encircles all.

30

Well do I know the way—so have no fear.



‘This swamp, which belches forth such noxious stench,

hems in the woeful city, circling it.

33

Now we cannot enter without wrath.’ →



And he said more, but I do not remember,

for my eyes and thoughts were drawn

36

to the high tower’s blazing peak



where all at once, erect, had risen

three hellish, blood-stained Furies: →

39

they had the limbs and shape of women,



their waists encircled by green hydras.

Thin serpents and horned snakes entwined,

42

in place of hair, their savage brows.



And he, who knew full well the handmaids

of the queen of endless lamentation,

45

said to me: ‘See the fierce Furies!



‘That is Megaera on the left. On the right

Alecto wails. In the middle

48

is Tisiphone.’ And with that he fell silent.



Each rent her breast with her own nails.

And with their palms they struck themselves, shrieking.

51

In fear I pressed close to the poet.



‘Let Medusa come and we’ll turn him to stone,’ →

they cried, looking down. ‘To our cost,

54

we failed to avenge the assault of Theseus.’ →



‘Turn your back and keep your eyes shut,

for if the Gorgon head appears and should you see it,

57

all chance for your return above is lost.’



While my master spoke he turned me round →

and, placing no trust in my own hands,

60

covered my face with his hands also.



O you who have sound intellects,

consider the teaching that is hidden

63

behind the veil of these strange verses.



And now there came, over the turbid waves, →

a dreadful, crashing sound

66

that set both shores to trembling.



It sounded like a mighty wind,

made violent by waves of heat,

69

that strikes the forest and with unchecked force



shatters the branches, hurls them away, and,

magnificent in its roiling cloud of dust, drives on,

72

putting beast and shepherd to flight.



He freed my eyes and said: ‘Now look →

across the scum of that primeval swamp

75

to where the vapor is most dense and harsh.’



As frogs, before their enemy the snake, →

all scatter through the water

78

till each sits huddled on the bank,



I saw more than a thousand lost souls flee

before one who so lightly passed across the Styx

81

he did not touch the water with his feet. →



He cleared the thick air from his face, →

his left hand moving it away,

84

as if that murky air alone had wearied him.



It was clear that he was sent from Heaven, →

and I turned to the master, who signaled me →

87

to keep silent and bow down before him.



Ah, how full of high disdain he seemed to me!

He came up to the gate and with a wand →

90

he opened it, and there was no resistance.



‘O outcasts of Heaven, race despised,’ →

he began on the terrible threshold, ‘whence

93

comes this insolence you harbor in your souls? →



‘Why do you kick against that will

which never can be severed from its purpose,

96

and has so many times increased your pain?



‘What profits it to fight against the fates?

Remember your own Cerberus still bears

99

the wounds of that around his chin and neck.’



Then he turned back along the wretched way →

without a word for us, and he seemed pressed,

102

spurred on by greater cares



than those of the man who stands before him.

We turned our steps toward the city,

105

emboldened by his holy words.



We entered without further struggle. →

And I, in my desire to see

108

what such a guarded fortress holds,



as soon as I had entered eagerly surveyed

the wide plain stretching on all sides,

111

so filled with bitter torment and despair.



Just as at Arles where the Rhone goes shallow, →

just as at Pola, near Quarnero’s gulf,

114

which hems in Italy and bathes her borders,



the sepulchers make the land uneven,

so all around me in this landscape

117

the many tombs held even greater sorrow.



For here the graves were strewn with flames

that made them glow with heat

120

hotter than iron is before it’s worked.



All their covers were propped open and from them

issued such dire lamentation it was clear

123

it came from wretches in despair and pain.



And I: ‘Master, who are these souls

entombed within these chests and who make known

126

their plight with sighs of sorrow?’



And he: ‘Here, with all their followers, →

are the arch-heretics of every sect.

129

The tombs are far more laden than you think.



‘Like is buried here with like,

though their graves burn with unlike heat.’

Then, once he had turned to his right, →

133

we passed between the torments and the lofty ramparts.

64–66

he knows Cavalcante from his words and situation

67–72

the father assumes his son is dead and falls back



73–93

Dante’s second exchange with Farinata:

73–81

coda: resumption of leftward direction in descent





INFERNO X


Now my master takes a hidden path →

between the city’s ramparts and the torments,

3

and I come close behind him.



‘O lofty virtue,’ I began, ‘who lead me

as you will around these impious circles, →

6

speak to me and satisfy my wishes.



‘The souls that lie within the sepulchres,

may they be seen? For all the lids are raised →

9

and there is no one standing guard.’



And he to me: ‘All will be shut and sealed

when the souls return from Jehosaphat →

12

with the bodies they have left above.



‘Here Epicurus and all his followers,

who hold the soul dies with the body, →

15

have their burial place.



‘But soon your need to have an answer

will be satisfied right here,

18

as will the wish you hide from me.’ →



And I: ‘Good leader, from you I do not keep

my heart concealed except to speak few words—

21

as you’ve from time to time advised.’



‘O Tuscan, passing through the city of fire, →

alive, and with such courtesy of speech,

24

if it would please you, stay your steps awhile.



‘Your way of speaking makes it clear →

that you are native to that noble city

27

to which I was perhaps too cruel.’ →



This voice came suddenly

from one sarcophagus, so that, startled,

30

I drew closer to my leader.



And he to me: ‘Turn back! What are you doing?

Look, there Farinata stands erect— →

33

you can see all of him from the waist up.’ →



Already I had fixed my gaze on his.

And he was rising, lifting chest and brow →

36

as though he held all Hell in utter scorn.



At which my leader: ‘Choose your words with care,’

and his hands, ready, encouraging,

39

thrust me toward him among the tombs.



When I stood at the foot of his tomb

he looked at me a moment. Then he asked,

42

almost in disdain: ‘Who were your ancestors?’ →



And I, eager, held nothing back,

but told him who they were,

45

at which he barely raised his eyebrows →



and said: ‘They were most bitter enemies →

to me, my forebears, and my party—

48

not once, but twice, I had to drive them out.’



‘If they were banished,’ I responded, ‘they returned →

from every quarter both the first time and the second,

51

a skill that Yours have failed to learn as well.’



Then, beside him, in the open tomb, up came →

a shade, visible to the chin: I think

54

he had raised himself upon his knees.



He looked around me as though he wished to see

if someone else were with me,

57

and when his hesitant hopes were crushed,



weeping, he said: ‘If you pass through this dark →

prison by virtue of your lofty genius, →

60

where is my son and why is he not with you?’ →



And I to him: ‘I come not on my own: →

he who stands there waiting leads me through, →

63

perhaps to one Your Guido held in scorn.’



His words and the manner of his punishment

already had revealed his name to me,

66

and thus was my reply so to the point.



Suddenly erect, he cried: ‘What? →

Did you say “he held”? Lives he not still?

69

Does not the sweet light fall upon his eyes?’



When he perceived that I made some delay →

before I answered, he fell backward

72

and showed himself no more.



But the other, that great soul at whose wish →

I had stopped, did not change countenance,

75

nor bend his neck, nor move his chest.



And he, continuing from where he’d paused: →

‘That they have badly learned this skill

78

torments me more than does this bed.



‘But the face of the lady reigning here →

will be rekindled not fifty times before you too

81

shall know how difficult a skill that is to learn.



‘And, so may you return to the sweet world, →

tell me, why are your people,

84

in every edict, so pitiless against my kin?’



Then I to him: ‘The havoc and great slaughter →

that dyed the Arbia red caused them to raise

87

such prayers in our temple.’



He sighed and shook his head, then spoke:

‘I was not alone, nor surely without cause →

90

would I have acted with the rest.



‘But it was I alone, when all agreed

to make an end of Florence, I alone

93

who dared speak out in her defense.’



‘So may Your seed sometime find peace, →

pray untie for me this knot,’ I begged him,

96

‘which has entangled and confused my judgment.



‘From what I hear, it seems

you see beforehand that which time will bring,

99

but cannot know what happens in the present.’



‘We see, like those with faulty vision, →

things at a distance,’ he replied. ‘That much,

102

for us, the mighty Ruler’s light still shines.



‘When things draw near or happen now,

our minds are useless. Without the words of others

105

we can know nothing of your human state.



‘Thus it follows that all our knowledge

will perish at the very moment

108

the portals of the future close.’



Then, remorseful for my fault, I said: →

‘Will You tell him who fell back down

111

his son is still among the living?



‘And let him know, if I was slow to answer,

it was because I was preoccupied

114

with doubts You have resolved for me.’



And now my master summoned me,

so that I begged the spirit to reveal,

117

at once, who else was down there with him.



His answer was: ‘More than a thousand lie

here with me: both the second Frederick →

120

and the Cardinal. Of the rest I do not speak.’ →



With that he dropped from sight. I turned my steps

to the venerable poet, mulling

123

those words that seemed to augur ill. →



He started out, and then, as we were going,

asked: ‘Why are you so bewildered?’ →

126

And I answered fully what he asked.



‘Keep in mind what you have heard against you,

but also now give heed to this,’

129

the sage insisted—and he raised one finger.



‘When you shall stand before the radiance →

of her whose fair eyes see and understand,

132

from her you’ll learn the journey of your life.’



Then he turned his footsteps to the left. →

Leaving the wall, we headed toward the center

along a path that leads into a pit.

136

Its stench offended even at that height.

treachery, a worse form of fraud (Circle 9)

Dante still puzzled by Virgil’s words about usury

97–111

Virgil on the sin against art, “God’s grandchild”

112–115

coda: Virgil announces it is time to go (ca. 4 am)





INFERNO XI


At the brink of a high bank formed

by broken boulders in a circle

3

we stopped above a still more grievous throng. →



Here, the unbearable foul stench

belched from that bottomless abyss

6

made us draw back behind the slab →



of an imposing tomb, on which I saw inscribed

the words: ‘I hold Pope Anastasius: →

9

Photinus drew him from the right and proper path.’



‘We must delay descending so our sense, →

inured to that vile stench,

12

no longer heeds it.’



So spoke the master. I replied: ‘I know

you’ll find a useful way to pass this time.’

15

And he: ‘You’ll see that is my plan.’



‘My son,’ he then began, ‘beneath these rocks

there are three circles, smaller, one below the other,

18

but otherwise like those you leave behind.



‘All these are filled with souls condemned.

So that the sight alone may later be enough,

21

know how and why they are confined this way.



‘Every evil deed despised in Heaven →

has as its end injustice. Each such end

24

harms someone else through either force or fraud.



‘But since the vice of fraud is man’s alone,

it more displeases God, and thus the fraudulent

27

are lower down, assailed by greater pain.



‘The first circle holds the violent →

but is divided and constructed in three rings,

30

since violence takes three different forms.



‘Violence may be aimed at God, oneself,

or at one’s neighbor—thus against all three

33

or their possessions—as I shall now explain.



‘Violent death and grievous wounds may be inflicted →

upon a neighbor or, upon his goods,

36

pillage, arson, and violent theft.



‘And so murderers and everyone who wounds

unjustly, spoilers and plunderers—the first ring

39

punishes all these in separate groups.



‘A man may lay injurious hands upon himself →

or on his goods, and for that reason

42

in the second ring must he repent in vain



‘who robs himself of the world above

or gambles away and wastes his substance,

45

lamenting when he should rejoice.



‘Violence may be committed against God →

when we deny and curse Him in our hearts,

48

or when we scorn nature and her bounty.



‘And so the smallest ring stamps with its seal

both Sodom and Cahors and those

51

who scorn Him with their hearts and tongues.



‘Fraud gnaws at every conscience, →

whether used on him who trusted

54

or on one who lacked such faith.



‘Fraud against the latter only severs

the bond of love that nature makes.

57

Thus in the second circle nest



‘hypocrisy, flatteries, and sorcerers;

lies, theft, and simony;

60

panders, barrators, and all such filth.



‘Fraud against the trusting fails to heed →

not only natural love but the added bond

63

of faith, which forms a special kind of trust.



‘Therefore, in the tightest circle,

the center of the universe and seat of Dis,

66

all traitors are consumed eternally.’



And I: ‘Master, your account is clear →

and clearly designates the nature

69

of this abyss and its inhabitants.



‘But tell me, those spirits in the viscous marsh,

those the wind drives, those the rain beats down on,

72

those clashing with such bitter tongues,



‘why are they not punished inside the fiery city

if God’s anger is upon them?

75

And if not, why are they so afflicted?’



And he: ‘Not often do your wits stray →

far afield, as they do now—or is your mind

78

bent on pursuing other thoughts?



‘Do you not recall the words

your Ethics uses to expound

81

the three dispositions Heaven opposes,



‘incontinence, malice, and mad brutishness,

and how incontinence offends God less

84

and incurs a lesser blame?



‘If you consider well this judgment

and consider who they are

87

that suffer punishment above, outside the wall,



‘you’ll understand why they are set apart

from these wicked spirits and why God’s vengeance

90

smites them with a lesser wrath.’



‘O sun, you who heal all troubled sight, →

you so content me by resolving doubts

93

it pleases me no less to question than to know.



‘But go back a little way,’ I said,

‘to where you told me usury offends

96

God’s goodness, and untie that knot for me.’



‘Philosophy, for one who understands her, →

observes,’ he said, ‘and not in one place only,

99

how nature takes her course



‘from heavenly intellect and its operation.

And, if you study well your Physics,

102

you will find, after not too many pages,



‘that human toil, as far as it is able,

follows nature, as the pupil does his master,

105

so that it is God’s grandchild, as it were.



‘By toil and nature, if you remember Genesis,

near the beginning, it is man’s lot

108

to earn his bread and prosper.



‘The usurer, who takes another path,

scorns nature in herself and in her follower,

111

and elsewhere sets his hopes.



‘But follow me now, for it is time to go. →

The Fishes are flickering at the horizon

and all the Wain lies over Caurus. And here,

115

a short way off, is the descent.’

139

coda: Nessus crosses back over the river





INFERNO XII


Steep was the cliff we had to clamber down,

rocky and steep, but—even worse—it held

3

a sight that every eye would shun.



As on the rockslide that still marks the flank →

of the Àdige, this side of Trent,

6

whether by earthquake or erosion at the base,



from the mountain-top they slid away from,

the shattered boulders strew the precipice

9

and thus give footing to one coming down—



just so was the descent down that ravine.

And at the chasm’s jagged edge

12

was sprawled the infamy of Crete, →



conceived in that false cow.

When he caught sight of us, he gnawed himself

15

like someone ruled by wrath.



My sage cried out to him: ‘You think, →

perhaps, this is the Duke of Athens,

18

who in the world above put you to death.



‘Get away, you beast, for this man

does not come tutored by your sister,

21

he comes to view your punishments.’



Like the bull that breaks its tether →

just as it receives the mortal blow

24

and cannot run, but lunges here and there,



so raged the Minotaur. My artful guide

called out: ‘Run to the passage:

27

hurry down while he is in his fury.’



And so we made our way down the steep landslide →

on scree that often shifted

30

under my feet with unexpected weight.



I went on lost in thought. And he said:

‘Perhaps you’re wondering about this rockslide →

33

guarded by that bestial rage I quelled just now. →



‘I want you to know, the other time →

I came down into nether Hell

36

this rock had not yet fallen.



‘But surely, if memory does not fail,

it was just before He came who carried off

39

from Dis the great spoil of the highest circle →



‘when the deep and foul abyss shook on every side, →

so that I thought the universe felt love,

42

by which, as some believe,



‘the world has many times been turned to chaos.

And at that moment this ancient rock,

45

here and elsewhere, fell broken into pieces.



‘But fix your eyes below, for we draw near

the river of blood that scalds

48

those who by violence do injury to others.’ →



O blind covetousness, insensate wrath, →

which in this brief life goad us on and then,

51

in the eternal, steep us in such misery!



I saw a broad moat curving in its arc

that seemed to circle all the plain,

54

just as my guide had said.



Between the edge of moat and precipice

ran centaurs in a file and armed with arrows, →

57

as when they went off hunting in our world.



They saw us coming, stopped, and three →

departed from the troop with bows

60

and shafts they had selected with great care.



One cried from afar: ‘To what torment

do you come, you two approaching down the slope?

63

Tell us from there. If not, I draw my bow.’



My master said: ‘We will give our answer →

to Chiron once we have come closer.

66

Your will was always hasty, to your hurt.’



Then he nudged me, saying: ‘That is Nessus, →

who died for lovely Deianira

69

and fashioned of himself his own revenge.



‘The middle one, his gaze fixed on his chest, →

is the great Chiron, he who raised Achilles.

72

The other one is Pholus, who was so filled with wrath. →



‘Around the moat they go in thousands,

shooting arrows at any soul that rises

75

higher from the blood than guilt allows.’ →



As we drew near those swift wild beasts, →

Chiron took an arrow and with its nock

78

pulled back his beard along his jaw.



When he had uncovered his enormous mouth

he said to his companions: ‘Have you observed

81

the one behind dislodges what he touches?



‘That is not what the feet of dead men do.’

And my good leader, now at Chiron’s breast,

84

where his two natures join, replied:



‘He is indeed alive, and so alone,

it is my task to show him this dark valley.

87

Necessity compels us, not delight.



‘One briefly left her song of hallelujah →

and came to charge me with this novel task.

90

He is no robber, nor am I a thief.



‘But, by that power by which I move my steps

on this wild road, lend us a guide,

93

one of your band to whom we may stay close, →



‘one who will show us to the ford

and carry this man over on his back,

96

for he is not a spirit that can fly through air.’



Chiron bent his torso to the right, then said →

to Nessus: ‘Go back and guide them.

99

If you meet another troop, have it give way.’



And with this trusty escort we went on,

skirting the edge of the vermilion boil

102

from which the boiled cried out with piercing shrieks.



There I saw some sunken to the eyebrows,

and the great centaur said: ‘They are tyrants →

105

who took to blood and plunder.



‘Here they lament their ruthless crimes. →

Here is Alexander, here cruel Dionysius,

108

who gave to Sicily its years of woe.



‘And that brow with such jet-black hair

is Ezzelino, while the other blond one there

111

is Obizzo d’Este, who was indeed



‘slain by his stepson in the world above.’

Then I turned to the poet, and he said:

114

‘Now let Nessus be your guide and I will follow.’ →



A little farther on the centaur stopped

above a crowd whose heads, down to their necks, →

117

seemed to issue from that boiling stream.



He pointed out a shade apart, alone:

‘In God’s bosom that one clove in two

120

the heart that on the Thames still drips with blood.’



Then I saw some who had their heads, →

even their whole chests, out of the river,

123

and of these I recognized a number,



as the blood became even more shallow →

until it cooked nothing but their feet.

126

And here was our place to cross the moat. →



‘Just as on this side you can see →

the boiling stream always diminishing,’

129

said the centaur, ‘so, I’ll have you know,



‘on the other side the bottom falls away

until it plumbs the depths

132

where tyranny must groan.



‘There divine justice stings Attila, →

who was a scourge on earth, and Pyrrhus,

135

and Sextus, and eternally wrings



‘tears, loosed by the boiling, →

from Rinier of Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,

who on the highways made such strife.’

139

Then he turned back and crossed the ford again. →

INFERNO XIII


Nessus had not yet reached the other side →

when we made our way into a forest

3

not marked by any path.



No green leaves, but those of dusky hue— →

not a straight branch, but knotted and contorted—

6

no fruit of any kind, but poisonous thorns.



No rougher, denser thickets make a refuge

for the wild beasts that hate tilled lands

9

between the Cècina and Corneto.



Here the filthy Harpies nest, →

who drove the Trojans from the Strophades

12

with doleful prophecies of woe to come.



They have broad wings, human necks and faces,

taloned feet, and feathers on their bulging bellies.

15

Their wailing fills the eerie trees.



And my good master then began to speak:

‘Before you go in deeper you should know,

18

you are, and will be, in the second ring



‘until you reach the dreadful sand. Look well—

you will see things that, in my telling, →

21

would seem to strip my words of truth.’



Lamentations I heard on every side

but I saw no one who might be crying out

24

so that, confused, I stopped. →



I think he thought that I thought →

all these voices in among the branches

27

came from people hiding there.



And so the master said: ‘If you break off

a twig among these brambles,

30

your present thoughts will be cut short.’



Then I stretched out my hand →

and plucked a twig from a tall thorn-bush,

33

and its stem cried out: ‘Why do you break me?’



When it ran dark with blood

it cried again: ‘Why do you tear me?

36

Are you completely without pity?



‘We once were men and now are turned to thorns.

Your hand might well have been more merciful

39

had we been souls of snakes.’



As from a green log, burning at one end, →

that blisters and hisses at the other

42

with the rush of sap and air,



so from the broken splinter oozed

blood and words together, and I let drop

45

the twig and stood like one afraid.



‘Could he have believed it otherwise, →

O wounded soul,’ my sage spoke up,

48

‘what he has seen only in my verses,



‘he would not have raised his hand against you.

But your plight, being incredible, made me

51

goad him to this deed that weighs on me.



‘Now tell him who you were, so that, by way →

of recompense, he may revive your fame

54

up in the world, where he’s permitted to return.’



And the stem said: ‘With your pleasing words →

you so allure me I cannot keep silent.

57

May it not offend if I am now enticed to speak.



‘I am the one who held both keys →

to Frederick’s heart, and I could turn them,

60

locking and unlocking, so discreetly



‘I kept his secrets safe from almost everyone.

So faithful was I to that glorious office

63

that first I lost my sleep and then my life.



‘The slut who never took her whoring eyes →

from Caesar’s household, the common bane

66

and special vice of courts,



‘inflamed all minds against me.

And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus →

69

that welcome honors turned to dismal woe.



‘My mind, in scornful temper, →

hoping by dying to escape from scorn,

72

made me, though just, against myself unjust.



‘By this tree’s new-sprung roots I give my oath: →

not once did I break faith

75

with my true lord, a man so worthy of honor.



‘If one of you goes back into the world,

let him restore my reputation, which, helpless,

78

lies beneath the blow that envy dealt it.’



The poet waited, then he said to me:

‘Since he is silent now do not waste time

81

but speak if you would ask him more.’



And I replied: ‘Please question him →

about the things you think I need to know.

84

For I cannot, such pity fills my heart.’



Thus he began again: ‘So that this man may,

with ready will, do as your words entreat,

87

may it please you, imprisoned spirit,



‘to tell us further how the souls are bound

inside such gnarled wood, and tell us, if you can,

90

if from such limbs one ever is set free.’



Then the tree forced out harsh breath, and soon

that wind was turned into a voice:

93

‘My answer shall be brief.



‘When the ferocious soul deserts the body

after it has wrenched up its own roots,

96

Minos condemns it to the seventh gulch.



‘It falls into the forest, in a spot not chosen,

but flung by fortune, helter-skelter,

99

it fastens like a seed.



‘It spreads into a shoot, then a wild thicket.

The Harpies, feeding on its leaves,

102

give pain and to that pain a mouth.



‘We will come to claim our cast-off bodies

like the others. But it would not be just if we again

105

put on the flesh we robbed from our own souls.



‘Here shall we drag it, and in this dismal wood

our bodies will be hung, each one

108

upon the thorn-bush of its painful shade.’



Our attention was still fixed upon the tree, →

thinking it had more to tell us,

111

when we were startled by a noise,



as a man, when he hears

the dogs, and branches snapping,

114

knows the boar and hunters near.



Now, from the left, two souls came running,

naked and torn, and so intent on flight

117

they broke straight through the tangled thicket.



The one in front cried: ‘Come, come quickly, death!’

And the other, who thought his own pace slow:

120

‘Lano, your legs were not so nimble



‘at the tournament near the Toppo.’

Then, almost out of breath, he pressed himself

123

into a single tangle with a bush.



Behind them now the woods were thick

with bitches, black and ravenous and swift

126

as hounds loosed from the leash.



On him who had hidden in the tangle

they set their teeth, tore him to pieces,

129

and carried off those miserable limbs.



And then my leader took me by the hand. →

He led me to the bush,

132

which wept in vain lament from bleeding wounds.



‘O Jacopo da Sant’ Andrea,’ it said,

‘what use was it to make a screen of me?

135

Why must I suffer for your guilty life?’



When the master stopped beside it, he said:

‘Who were you, that through so many wounds

138

pour out with blood your doleful words?’



And he to us: ‘O souls who have arrived →

to see the shameless carnage

141

that has torn from me my leaves,



‘gather them here at the foot of this wretched bush.

I was of the city that traded patrons—

144

Mars for John the Baptist. On that account



‘Mars with his craft will make her grieve forever.

And were it not that at the crossing of the Arno

147

some vestige of him still remains,



‘those citizens who afterwards rebuilt it

upon the ashes that Attila left behind

would have done their work in vain.

151

I made my house into my gallows.’

INFERNO XIV


Urged by the love I bore my place of birth, →

I gathered up the scattered leaves and gave them back

3

to him, who had by this time spent his breath.



Then we came to the boundary that divides →

the second circling from the third.

6

And here the dreadful work of justice is revealed.



To tell how strange the new place was, →

I say we reached a barren plain

9

that lets no plant set root into its soil.



The gloomy forest rings it like a garland

and is in turn encircled by the moat.

12

Here, at the very edge, we stayed our steps



at an expanse of deep and arid sand,

much like the sand pressed long ago →

15

beneath the feet of Cato.



O vengeance of God, how much

should you be feared by all who read

18

what now I saw revealed before my eyes!



I saw many a herd of naked souls, →

all crying out in equal misery,

21

though each seemed subject to a different law:



some lay face up upon the ground,

some sat, their bodies hunched,

24

and others roamed about in constant motion.



Most numerous were those who roamed about,

those lying there in torment fewer,

27

though theirs the tongues crying out the most.



Above the stretching sand, in slow descent, →

broad flakes of fire showered down

30

as snow falls in the hills on windless days. →



If Alexander, on India’s torrid plains, →

seeing undiminished flakes of fire fall

33

upon the ground and on his troops,



ordered his men to trample down the soil

so that the flaming shower was put out

36

before the fire caught and spread,



here untrammeled the eternal flames

came down, and the sand took fire

39

like tinder under flint, doubling the torment.



Ever without repose was the rude dance →

of wretched hands, now here, now there,

42

slapping at each new scorching cinder.



I began: ‘Master, you who overcome all things— →

all but the obstinate fiends who sallied forth

45

against us at the threshold of the gate,



‘who is that hero who seems to scorn the fire →

and lies there grim and scowling

48

so that the rain seems not to torture him?’



And he himself, who had discerned →

that I had asked my guide about him,

51

cried: ‘What I was alive, I am in death. →



‘Let Jove wear out his blacksmith

from whom in rage he seized the shining bolt

54

he struck me with on that my final day.



‘And though he weary all the others, one by one,

at their black forge in Mongibello,

57

shouting “Help, good Vulcan, help!”



‘as once he did on the battlefield of Phlegra,

and though he hurl his shafts at me with all his might,

60

he still would have no joy in his revenge.’



Then my leader spoke with a vehemence →

I had not heard him use before: ‘O, Capaneus,

63

because your pride remains unquenched



‘you suffer greater punishment.

In your own anger lies your agony,

66

a fitting torment for your rage.’



Then, with a calmer look, he said to me:

‘He was among the seven kings who once laid siege

69

to Thebes and held—and he still seems to hold— →



‘God in disdain and to esteem Him lightly.

But his own spiteful ranting, as I made clear,

72

most fittingly adorns his breast.



‘Now come along behind me, and be sure

you do not set your feet upon the burning sand

75

but keep your steps close to the forest’s edge.’



In silence we went on until we came →

to where a little stream spurts from the wood.

78

The redness of it makes me shudder still.



As from the Bulicame flows out a rivulet

the sinful women then divide among them,

81

so this ran down across the sand.



Its bed and both its banks were made of stone,

as was the boundary on either side:

84

I saw our passage lay that way.



‘In all else I have shown you

since we entered through the gate

87

whose threshold is denied to none,



‘your eyes have yet seen nothing of such note

as is this stream before us:

90

its vapor quenches every flame above it.’



These were my leader’s words. Hearing them,

I asked him to supply the food

93

for which he had provoked the appetite.



‘In the middle of the sea there lies a land,’ → →

he said, ‘a wasteland known as Crete.

96

Under its king the world was innocent.



‘A mountain rises there, once glad

with leaves and streams, called Ida.

99

Now it is barren like a thing outworn.



‘Once Rhea chose it as the trusted cradle

for her child, and there, the better to conceal him

102

when he cried, she had her people raise an uproar.



‘Within the mountain stands a huge old man. →

He keeps his back turned on Damietta,

105

gazing on Rome as in his mirror.



‘His head is fashioned of fine gold,

his breast and arms of purest silver,

108

then to the fork he’s made of brass,



‘and from there down he is all iron,

but for his right foot of baked clay,

111

and he rests more on this than on the other.



‘Every part except the gold is rent →

by a crack that drips with tears, which, running down,

114

collect to force a passage through that cavern,



‘taking their course from rock to rock into this depth, →

where they form Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon,

117

then, going down this narrow channel,



‘down to where there is no more descent,

they form Cocytus: what kind of pond that is

120

you shall see in time—here I say no more.’



Then I asked: ‘If that stream flows

down from our world, why do we see it

123

only at this boundary?’



And he answered: ‘You know this place is round,

and though you have come far,

126

descending toward the bottom on the left,



‘you have not come full circle.

Should some new thing confront us,

129

it need not bring such wonder to your face.’



And I again: ‘Master, where are Phlegethon and Lethe? →

About the one you’re silent, and you say the other

132

is made into a river by this rain.’



‘In all your questions you do please me,’

he replied, ‘but the red and seething water

135

might well have answered one of those you ask.



‘Lethe you shall see: not in this abyss

but where the spirits go to cleanse themselves

138

once their repented guilt has been removed.’



And then: ‘Now it is time to leave this forest. →

See you stay close behind me.

The borders, which are not on fire, form a path

142

and over both of them all flames are quenched.’

INFERNO XV


Now one of the stony borders bears us on →

and vapors from the stream arise as mist

3

protecting banks and water from the flames.



As the Flemings between Wissant and Bruges, →

fearing the tide that rushes in upon them,

6

erect a bulwark to repel the sea,



and as the Paduans build dikes along the Brenta,

to protect their towns and castles

9

before the heat brings floods to Carentana—



in just that way these banks were formed,

except the architect—whoever he was—

12

had made them not as lofty nor as thick.



By now we were so distant from the wood →

that I could not have made it out

15

even had I turned in its direction.



Here we met a troop of souls

coming up along the bank, and each one

18

gazed at us as men at dusk will sometimes do,



eyeing one another under the new moon.

They peered at us with knitted brows

21

like an old tailor at his needle’s eye.



Thus scrutinized by such a company,

I was known to one of them who caught me →

24

by the hem and then cried out, ‘What a wonder!’



And while he held his arm outstretched to me,

I fixed my eyes on his scorched face

27

until beneath the charred disfigurement



I could discern the features that I knew →

and, lowering my hand toward his face,

30

asked: ‘Are You here, Ser Brunetto?’



And he: ‘O my son, let it not displease you

if Brunetto Latini for a while turns back

33

with you and lets the troop go on.’



I said to him: ‘With all my heart, I pray You,

and if You would have me sit with You, I will,

36

if he who leads me through allows.’



‘O son,’ he said, ‘whoever of this flock stops

even for an instant has to lie a hundred years,

39

unable to fend off the fire when it strikes.



‘Therefore, go on. I shall follow at your hem

and later will rejoin my band,

42

who go lamenting their eternal pain.’



I did not dare to leave the higher path

to walk the lower with him, but I kept

45

my head bowed, like one who walks in reverence.



He began: ‘What chance or fate is it

that brings you here before your final hour,

48

and who is this that shows the way?’ →



‘In the sunlit life above,’ I answered,

‘in a valley there, I lost my way →

51

before I reached the zenith of my days.



‘Only yesterday morning did I leave it,

but had turned back when he appeared,

54

and now along this road he leads me home.’ →



And he to me: ‘By following your star →

you cannot fail to reach a glorious port,

57

if I saw clearly in the happy life.



‘Had I not died too soon, →

seeing that Heaven so favors you,

60

I would have lent you comfort in your work.



‘But that malignant, thankless rabble →

that came down from Fiesole long ago

63

and still smacks of the mountain and the rock



‘rightly shall become, because of your good deeds,

your enemy: among the bitter sorbs

66

it is not fit the sweet fig come to fruit.



‘The world has long believed them to be blind,

a people greedy, envious and proud.

69

Be sure you stay untainted by their ways.



‘Your destiny reserves for you such honor

both parties shall be hungry to devour you,

72

but the grass shall be far from the goat.



‘Let the Fiesolan beasts make forage

of themselves but spare the plant,

75

if on their dung-heap any still springs up,



‘the plant in which lives on the holy seed

of those few Romans who remained

78

when it became the home of so much malice.’



‘If all my prayers were answered,’

I said to him, ‘You would not yet

81

be banished from mankind.



‘For I remember well and now lament

the cherished, kind, paternal image of You →

84

when, there in the world, from time to time,



‘You taught me how man makes himself immortal.

And how much gratitude I owe for that

87

my tongue, while I still live, must give report.



‘What You tell of my future I record →

and keep for glossing, along with other texts,

90

by a lady of discernment, should I reach her.



‘This much I would have You know: →

as long as conscience does not chide,

93

I am prepared for Fortune as she wills.



‘Such prophecy is not unknown to me.

Let Fortune spin her wheel just as she pleases, →

96

and let the loutish peasant ply his hoe.’



At that I saw the right side of my master’s face

turned back in my direction. And he said:

99

‘He listens well who takes in what he hears.’ →



Nonetheless, I go on speaking

with ser Brunetto, asking who, of his companions,

102

are most eminent, most worthy to be known.



And he: “Some of them it is good to know.

Others it is better not to mention,

105

for the time would be too short for so much talk.



‘In sum, note that all of them were clerics →

or great and famous scholars, all befouled

108

in the world above by a single sin.



‘Priscian goes with that wretched crowd,

and Francesco d’Accorso too. And, had you had

111

a hankering for such filth, you might have seen



‘the one transferred by the Servant of Servants

from the Arno to the Bacchiglione,

114

where he left his sin-stretched sinews.



‘I would say more, but I cannot stay,

cannot continue talking, for over there I see

117

new smoke rising from the sand.



‘People are coming with whom I must not be. →

Let my Treasure, in which I still live on, →

120

be in your mind—I ask for nothing more.’



After he turned back he seemed like one →

who races for the green cloth on the plain

beyond Verona. And he looked more the winner

124

than the one who trails the field.

Rusticucci: do valor and courtesy still abide in Florence, or is Guglielmo Borsiere right?

73–78

Dante: he is right; their stunned reaction

86–90

they withdraw; Dante and Virgil continue on

Dante’s oath to his readers (third address in the poem) and the figure (Geryon) rising from the depths





INFERNO XVI


I had arrived where we could hear the distant roar →

of water falling to the lower circle,

3

like the rumbling hum of bees around a hive,



when three shades at a run

broke from a passing crowd

6

under that rain of bitter torment.



Together they came toward us, each one calling:

‘Stop, you, who by your garb appear to be

9

a man from our degenerate city.’



Oh, what sores I noticed on their limbs,

both old and new ones, branded by the flames!

12

It pains me still, when I remember them.



My teacher was attentive to their cries,

then turned his face to me and said:

15

‘Now wait: to these one must show courtesy. →



‘And were it not for the fire that the nature

of this place draws down, I would say

18

that haste suits you far more than it does them.’



When we stopped, they took up again →

their old refrain but, once they reached us,

21

all three had joined into a single wheel.



As combatants, oiled and naked, are wont to do,

watching for their hold and their advantage,

24

before the exchange of thrusts and blows,



wheeling, each fixed his eyes on me,

so that their feet moved forward

27

while their necks were straining back.



One began: ‘If the squalor of this shifting sand →

and our blackened, hairless faces

30

put us and our petitions in contempt,



‘let our fame prevail on you

to tell us who you are, who fearless

33

move on living feet through Hell.



‘He in whose steps you see me tread,

though he go naked, peeled hairless by the fire,

36

was of a higher rank than you imagine.



‘He was grandson of the good Gualdrada.

Guido Guerra was his name. In his life

39

he did much with good sense, much with the sword.



‘This other, squinching sand behind me,

is Tegghiaio Aldobrandi, whose voice

42

deserved a better welcome in the world.



‘And I, who am put to torment with them,

was Jacopo Rusticucci. It was my bestial wife,

45

more than all else, who brought me to this pass.’



Had I been sheltered from the fire →

I would have thrown myself among them,

48

and I believe my teacher would have let me.



But because I would have burned and baked,

fright overcame the good intentions

51

that made me hunger to embrace them.



Then I began: ‘Not contempt, but sadness,

fixed your condition in my heart so deep—

54

it will be long before it leaves me—



‘the moment that my master’s words

made me consider that such worthy men

57

as you were coming near.



‘I am of your city. How many times →

I’ve heard your deeds, your honored names resound!

60

And I, too, spoke your names with affection.



‘I leave bitterness behind for the sweet fruits

promised by my truthful leader.

63

But first I must go down into the very core.’



‘That your spirit long may guide →

your limbs,’ he now added,

66

‘and your renown shine after you,



‘tell us if valor and courtesy still live

there in our city, as once they used to do,

69

or have they utterly forsaken her?



‘Guglielmo Borsiere, grieving with us here

so short a time, goes yonder with our company

72

and makes us worry with his words.’



‘The new crowd with their sudden profits →

have begot in you, Florence, such excess

75

and arrogance that you already weep.’



This, my face uplifted, I cried out. And the three, →

taking it for answer, looked at one another

78

as men do when they face the truth.



‘If at other times it costs so little

for you to give clear answers,’ they replied in turn,

81

‘happy are you to speak so freely.



‘Therefore, so may you escape from these dark regions →

to see again the beauty of the stars,

84

when you shall rejoice in saying “I was there,”



‘see that you speak of us to others.’

Then they broke their circle and as they fled

87

their nimble legs seemed wings.



‘Amen’ could not have been said as quickly →

as they vanished. And then my master

90

thought it time to leave.



I followed him, and we had not gone far →

before the roar of water was so close

93

we hardly could have heard each other speak.



As the river that is the first to hold →

its course from Monte Viso eastward

96

on the left slope of the Apennines,



and up there is called the Acquacheta,

before it pours into its lower bed

99

and, having lost that name at Forlì,



reverberates above San Benedetto

dell’Alpe, falling in one cataract

102

where there might well have been a thousand,



so, down from a precipitous bank, the flood

of that dark water coming down resounded

105

in our ears and almost stunned us.



I had a cord around my waist →

with which I once had meant to take

108

the leopard with the painted pelt.



After I had undone it, →

as my leader had commanded,

111

I gave it to him coiled and knotted.



Then, swinging round on his right side,

he flung it out some distance from the edge,

114

down into the depth of that abyss.



‘Surely,’ I said to myself, ‘something new →

and strange will answer this strange signal

117

the master follows with his eye.’



Ah, how cautious we should be with those

who do not see our actions only,

120

but with their wisdom peer into our thoughts!



He said to me: ‘Soon what I expect

and your mind only dreams of will appear.

123

Soon it shall be right before your eyes.’



To a truth that bears the face of falsehood →

a man should seal his lips if he is able,

126

for it might shame him, through no fault of his,



but here I can’t be silent. And by the strains

of this Comedy—so may they soon succeed

129

in finding favor—I swear to you, reader,



that I saw come swimming up

through that dense and murky air a shape

132

to cause amazement in the stoutest heart,



a shape most like a man’s who, having plunged →

to loose the anchor caught fast in a reef

or something other hidden in the sea, now rises,

136

reaching upward and drawing in his feet.

INFERNO XVII


‘Behold the beast with pointed tail, that leaps →

past mountains, shatters walls and weapons!

3

Behold the one whose stench afflicts the world!’



was how my guide began.

Then he signaled to the beast to come ashore

6

close to the border of our stony pathway.



And that foul effigy of fraud came forward,

beached its head and chest

9

but did not draw its tail up on the bank.



It had the features of a righteous man, →

benevolent in countenance,

12

but all the rest of it was serpent.



It had forepaws, hairy to the armpits,

and back and chest and both its flanks →

15

were painted and inscribed with rings and curlicues.



So many vivid colors Turk or Tartar never wove

in warp and woof or in embroidery on top,

18

nor were such colors patterned on Arachne’s loom.



As sometimes barges lie ashore, →

partly in water, partly on the land,

21

and as among the guzzling Germans



the beaver sets itself to catch its prey,

so lay this worst of brutes upon the stony rim

24

that makes a boundary for the sandy soil.



Its length of tail lashed in the void,

twisting up its forked, envenomed tip,

27

armed like a scorpion’s tail.



My leader said: ‘Now we must change →

direction for a moment till we reach

30

that evil beast stretched out down there.’



We descended, therefore, to our right,

and took ten steps along the edge to keep

33

our distance from the sand and flames.



And, when we reached the beast,

I see some people sitting on the sand

36

a short way off, near where it falls away.



Then the master said to me: ‘So that nothing →

in this circle escape your understanding,

39

go over and examine their condition.



‘Let your talk be brief.

While you are gone, I’ll ask the beast

42

to lend us its strong shoulders.’



Thus, on the seventh circle’s edge,

still farther out, I went alone

45

to where the downcast souls were seated. →



Their grief came bursting from their eyes.

With restless hands they sought relief,

48

now from the flame and now from burning sand.



Not otherwise do dogs in summer gnaw and scratch,

now with muzzle, now with paw,

51

when flies or fleas or horseflies bite them.



Although I searched some of the faces

of those on whom the painful fire descends,

54

I knew not one, but I could see



the pouches hanging from their necks →

were different in color, each with its coat of arms.

57

On these they seemed to feast their eyes.



And when I came among them and looked closer,

on a yellow purse I could make out →

60

a lion’s countenance and form in blue.



Then, farther on, my wandering gaze

made out another crest, blood-red, →

63

marked by a goose more white than butter.



And one, who had a pregnant sow, in azure, →

embossed on his white wallet, said to me:

66

‘What are you doing down here in this ditch?



‘Now go—but wait, since you’re still alive, →

know that my neighbor Vitaliano

69

shall soon be seated to my left.



‘Among these Florentines, I come from Padua.

Many a time they deafen me with shouting:

72

“May the sovereign knight come soon, →



‘ “who brings the pouch with three goats on it!” ’

Then he twisted his mouth and stuck out his tongue →

75

like an ox that licks its nose.



And I, fearing my delay might anger him

who had warned me to make my stay brief,

78

turned back and left those weary souls.



I found my leader mounted

on the shoulders of the savage beast.

81

He said to me: ‘Now be strong and resolute.



‘From here on we descend such stairs as these. →

You mount in front and I will take the middle

84

so that the tail may do no harm.’



As a man in a shivering-fit of quartan fever,

so ill his nails have lost all color,

87

trembles all over at the sight of shade,



so was I stricken at his words.

Rebuked by shame, which, in the presence

90

of a worthy master, makes a servant bold,



I mounted on those huge and ugly shoulders.

I wanted to say—though my voice did not come out

93

as I intended—‘Make sure you hold me fast!’



But he who had helped me many times before,

in other perils, clasped me in his arms

96

and steadied me as soon as I was mounted,



then said: ‘Geryon, move on now. Let your circles →

be wide and your descending slow.

99

Keep in mind your unaccustomed burden.’



As a bark backs slowly from its mooring,

so the beast backed off the ledge,

102

and when it felt itself adrift,



turned its tail to where its chest had been and,

extending it, made it wriggle like an eel’s,

105

while with its paws it gathered in the air.



Phaeton, I think, felt no greater fear →

when he released the reins and the whole sky

108

was scorched, as we still see,



nor wretched Icarus when he felt the melting wax →

unfeathering the wings along his back

111

and heard his father shout: ‘Not that way!’



than was my terror when I saw

air everywhere around

114

and all things gone from sight except the beast.



On it goes, swimming slowly, slowly →

wheeling, descending, but I feel only

117

the wind in my face and blowing from below.



Now on our right I heard the torrent’s hideous roar

below us, so that I thrust my head forward

120

and dared to look down the abyss.



Then I was even more afraid of being dropped,

for I saw fire and heard wailing,

123

and so, trembling, I hold on tighter with my legs.



And for the first time I became aware

of our descent and wheeling when I saw

126

the torments drawing closer all around me.



As the falcon that has long been on the wing— →

and, without sight of lure or bird

129

makes the falconer cry out: ‘Oh, you’re coming down!’—



descends, weary, with many a wheeling,

to where it set out swiftly, and alights,

132

angry and sullen, far from its master,



so Geryon set us down at the bottom,

at the very foot of the jagged cliff,

and, disburdened of our persons,

136

vanished like an arrow from the string.

flattery: Thaïs the whore; abrupt ending of canto





INFERNO XVIII


There is a place in Hell called Malebolge, →

fashioned entirely of iron-colored rock,

3

as is the escarpment that encircles it.



At the very center of this malignant space

there yawns a pit, extremely wide and deep.

6

I will describe its plan all in due time.



A path that circles like a belt around the base

of that high rock runs round the pit,

9

its sides descending in ten ditches.



As where concentric moats surround a castle

to guard its walls, their patterns clear

12

and governed by a meaningful design,



in such a pattern were these ditches shaped.

And, just as narrow bridges issue from the gates

15

of fortresses to reach the farthest bank,



so ridges stretched from the escarpment

down across the banks and ditches

18

into the pit at which they end and join.



Dropped from Geryon’s back, this was the place →

in which we found ourselves. The poet kept

21

to the left and I came on behind him.



To our right I saw a suffering new to me, →

new torments, and new scourgers,

24

with whom the first ditch was replete.



The sinners in its depth were naked,

those on our side of the center coming toward us,

27

the others moving with us, but with longer strides,



just as, because the throngs were vast the year →

of Jubilee, the Romans had to find a way

30

to let the people pass across the bridge,



so that all those on one side face the castle,

heading over to Saint Peter’s,

33

these, on the other, heading toward the mount.



Here and there on the dark rock above them

I watched horned demons armed with heavy scourges →

36

lashing them cruelly from behind.



Ah, how they made them pick their heels up

at the first stroke! You may be certain

39

no one waited for a second or a third.



While I went on my eye was caught

by one of them, and quickly I brought out:

42

‘It seems to me I’ve seen that man before.’



And so I paused to make him out.

My gentle leader stopped with me,

45

and then allowed me to retrace my steps.



The scourged soul thought that he could hide

by lowering his face—to no avail.

48

I said: ‘You there, with your eyes cast down,



‘if I’m not mistaken in your features,

you’re Venèdico Caccianemico. →

51

What has brought you to such stinging torture?’



And he replied: ‘Unwillingly I tell it,

moved only by the truth of what you’ve said,

54

which brings to mind the world that once I knew.



‘It was I who urged Ghisolabella

to do the will of that marquis,

57

no matter how the foul tale goes around.



‘I’m not the only Bolognese here lamenting. →

This place is so crammed with them

60

that not so many tongues have learned to say



‘ “sipa” between the Sàvena and the Reno.

And if you’d like some confirmation,

63

bring our greedy dispositions back to mind.’



While he was speaking a demon struck him

with his lash and said: ‘Away, pimp!

66

there are no women here to trick.’ →



Then I rejoined my escort. A few steps farther

and we came upon a place

69

where a ridge jutted from the bank.



This we ascended easily and,

turning to the right upon its jagged ledge,

72

we left behind their endless circling. →



When we came to the point above the hollow →

that makes a passage for the scourged,

75

my leader said: ‘Stop, let them look at you,



‘those other ill-born souls whose faces

you have not yet seen, since we have all

78

been moving in the same direction.’



From the ancient bridge we eyed the band

advancing toward us on the other side,

81

driven with whips just like the first.



And the good master, without my asking, said:

‘See that imposing figure drawing near. →

84

He seems to shed no tears despite his pain.



‘What regal aspect he still bears!

He is Jason, who by courage and by craft →

87

deprived the men of Colchis of the ram.



‘Then he ventured to the isle of Lemnos,

after those pitiless, bold women

90

put all the males among them to their death.



‘There with signs of love and polished words

he deceived the young Hypsipyle,

93

who had herself deceived the other women.



‘There he left her, pregnant and forlorn.

Such guilt condemns him to this torment,

96

and Medea too is thus avenged.



‘With him go all who practice such deceit.

Let that be all we know of this first ditch

99

and of the ones it clenches in its jaws.’



Now we had come to where the narrow causeway →

intersects the second ridge to form

102

a buttress for another arch.



From here we heard the whimpering of people

one ditch away, snuffling with their snouts

105

and beating on themselves with their own palms.



The banks, made slimy by a sticky vapor

from below, were coated with a mould

108

offending eyes and nose.



The bottom is so deep we could see nothing

unless we climbed to the crown of the arch,

111

just where the ridge is highest.



We went up, and from there I could see,

in a ditch below, people plunged in excrement

114

that could have come from human privies.



Searching the bottom with my eyes I saw

a man, his head so smeared with shit

117

one could not tell if he were priest or layman.



He railed: ‘What whets your appetite to stare at me

more than all the others in their filth?’

120

And I answered: ‘The fact, if I remember right,



‘that once I saw you when your hair was dry—

and you are Alessio Interminei of Lucca. →

123

That’s why I eye you more than all the rest.’



Then he, beating on his pate:

‘I am immersed down here for the flattery

126

with which my tongue was never cloyed.’



And then my leader said to me: ‘Try to thrust

your face a little farther forward,

129

to get a better picture of the features



‘of that foul, disheveled wench down there,

scratching herself with her filthy nails.

132

Now she squats and now she’s standing up.



‘She is Thaïs, the whore who, when her lover asked: →

“Have I found favor with you?”

answered, “Oh, beyond all measure!”

136

And let our eyes be satisfied with that.’

INFERNO XIX


O Simon Magus, o wretches of his band, →

greedy for gold and silver,

3

who prostitute the things of God



that should be brides of goodness!

Now must the trumpet sound for you,

6

because your place is there in that third ditch.



We had come to where the next tomb lay,

having climbed to the point upon the ridge

9

that overlooks the middle of the trench.



O Supreme Wisdom, what great art you show

in Heaven, on earth, and in the evil world,

12

and what true justice does your power dispense!



Along the sides and bottom I could see

the livid stone was pierced with holes,

15

all round and of a single size.



They seemed to me as wide and deep →

as those in my beautiful Saint John

18

made for the priests to baptize in,



one of which, not many years ago,

I broke to save one nearly drowned in it—

21

and let this be my seal, to undeceive all men.



From the mouth of each stuck out →

a sinner’s feet and legs up to the thighs

24

while all the rest stayed in the hole.



They all had both their soles on fire. →

It made their knee-joints writhe so hard

27

they would have severed twisted vines or ropes.



As flames move only on the surface →

of oily matter caught on fire,

30

so these flames flickered heel to toe.



‘Who is that, master, who in his torment

wriggles more than any of his fellows

33

and is licked by redder flames?’



And he: ‘If you like, I’ll take you down

along the lower bank and you will learn, →

36

from him, his life and his misdeeds.’



And I: ‘Whatever pleases you is my desire. →

You are my lord and know I do your will.

39

You know, too, what I leave unsaid.’



Then we came to the fourth embankment,

turned and descended on our left

42

into a narrow bottom pierced with holes.



The good master clasped me to his side

and did not set me down until we came

45

to the pit of one lamenting with his shanks.



‘Whatever you are, with your upper parts below, →

planted like a post, you wretched soul,’

48

said I, ‘come out with something, if you can.’



I stood there like a friar who confesses →

a treacherous assassin. Once fixed in place,

51

he calls the friar back to stay his death.



And he cried out: ‘Is that you already, →

are you here already, Boniface?

54

By several years the writing lied to me. →



‘Are you so swiftly sated with those profits

for which you did not fear to take by guile

57

the beautiful Lady and to do her outrage?’ →



I became like those who stand there mocked,

not comprehending what is said to them,

60

and thus not knowing what to say in turn.



Then Virgil said: ‘Tell him right away,

“I’m not the one, I’m not the one you think.” ’

63

I gave the answer I was told to give.



At that the spirit’s feet began to writhe.

Then, sighing, with a plaintive voice, he said:

66

‘What is it then you want from me?



‘If you are so keen to learn my name

that you descended from the bank for it,

69

know that I was cloaked in the great mantle. →



‘But in truth I was a son of the she-bear

and so avid was I to advance my cubs

72

I filled my purse as now I fill this hole.



‘Beneath my head are crushed the others

who practiced simony before me,

75

now flattened into fissures in the rock.



‘In turn I, too, shall be thrust lower down

as soon as he arrives whom I mistook you for

78

when I called out my hasty question.



‘But the time that I turned upside down, →

have roasted my feet even now exceeds

81

the time that he’ll be planted with his feet on fire.



‘For after him shall come a lawless shepherd

from the west, one even fouler in his deeds,

84

fit to be the cover over him and me.



‘A new Jason shall he be, the one of whom

we read in Maccabees, and even as the king indulged

87

Jason, so the king of France shall deal with him.’



I do not know if then I was too bold →

when I answered him in just this strain:

90

‘Please tell me, how much treasure →



‘did our Lord insist on from Saint Peter

before He gave the keys into his keeping?

93

Surely He asked no more than “Follow me,”



‘nor did Peter, or the others, take gold or silver

from Matthias when he was picked by lot

96

to fill the place lost by the guilty soul.



‘Stay there then, for you are justly punished,

guarding well those gains, ill-gotten,

99

that made you boldly take your stand against King Charles.



‘And were it not that I am still restrained

by the reverence I owe the keys supreme,

102

which once you held in the happy life above,



‘I would resort to even harsher words

because your avarice afflicts the world,

105

trampling down the good and raising up the wicked.



‘Shepherds like you the Evangelist had in mind

when he saw the one that sits upon the waters

108

committing fornication with the kings,



‘she that was born with seven heads

and from ten horns derived her strength

111

so long as virtue pleased her bridegroom.



‘You have wrought yourselves a god of gold and silver.

How then do you differ from those who worship idols

114

except they worship one and you a hundred?



‘Ah, Constantine, to what evil you gave birth, →

not by your conversion, but by the dowry

117

that the first rich Father had from you!’



And while I sang such notes to him,

whether gnawed by anger or by conscience,

120

he kicked out hard with both his feet.



Truly I believe this pleased my leader,

he listened with a look of such contentment

123

to the sound of the truthful words I spoke.



Therefore, he caught me in his arms →

and, when he had me all upon his breast,

126

remounted by the path he had descended,



nor did he tire of holding me so close

but bore me to the summit of the arch →

129

that crosses from the fourth dike to the fifth.



Here gently he set down his burden,

gently on account of the steep, rough ridge

that would have made hard going for a goat.

133

And there, before me, another valley opened.

INFERNO XX


Of strange new pain I now must make my verse, →

giving matter to the canto numbered twenty

3

of this first canzone, which tells of those submerged.



By now I was all eagerness to see →

what sights the chasm, bathed in tears

6

of anguish, would disclose.



I saw people come along that curving canyon

in silence, weeping, their pace the pace of slow

9

processions chanting litanies in the world.



As my gaze moved down along their shapes, →

I saw into what strange contortions

12

their chins and chests were twisted.



Their faces were reversed upon their shoulders →

so that they came on walking backward,

15

since seeing forward was denied them.



Perhaps some time by stroke of palsy

a person could be twisted in that way,

18

but I’ve not seen it nor do I think it likely.



Reader, so may God let you gather fruit →

from reading this, imagine, if you can,

21

how I could have kept from weeping



when I saw, up close, our human likeness

so contorted that tears from their eyes

24

ran down their buttocks, down into the cleft.



Yes, I wept, leaning against a spur →

of the rough crag, so that my escort said:

27

‘Are you still as witless as the rest?



’Here piety lives when pity is quite dead. →

Who is more impious than one who thinks

30

that God shows passion in His judgment?



‘Raise your head! Raise it and look on him →

under whose feet the earth gaped open

33

in sight of all the shouting Thebans:



‘ “Where are you rushing, Amphiaraus? Why

do you leave the war?” Nor did he stop his plunge

36

until he fell to Minos, who lays hold on all.



‘See how his shoulder-blades are now his chest.

Because he aspired to see too far ahead

39

he looks behind and treads a backward path.



‘See Tiresias, who changed his likeness →

when he was turned from male to female,

42

transformed in every member.



‘Later on he had to touch once more

the two twined serpents with his rod

45

before he could regain his manly plumes.



‘He who puts his back to that one’s belly is Aruns. →

In the hills of Luni—where the Carraresi,

48

who shelter in the valley, work the earth—



‘he lived inside a cave in that white marble,

from which he could observe the sea and stars

51

in a wide and boundless prospect.



‘And that female whose backward-flowing tresses →

fall upon her breasts so they are hidden,

54

and has her hairy parts on that same side,



‘was Manto, who searched through many lands

before she settled in the place where I was born—

57

for just a moment hear me out on this. →



’After her father had parted from this life

and the city of Bacchus was enslaved,

60

she wandered for a time about the world.



‘High in fair Italy, at the foot of the alps →

that form a border with Germany near Tyrol,

63

lies a lake they call Benàco.



‘By a thousand springs and more, I think, →

the region between Garda, Val Camonica, and Pennino

66

is bathed by waters settling in that lake.



‘There is an island in its middle

that the pastors of Trent, Brescia, and Verona,

69

should they pass that way, would bless.



‘Peschiera, a strong and splendid fortress →

against the Brescians and the Bergamese,

72

sits on the lowest point of land around.



‘There all the water Benàco’s bosom cannot hold →

flows over and descends into a river

75

running through green pastures.



‘This river, as it leaves the lake

and all the way to Govérnolo, is called

78

Mincio until it falls into the Po.



‘Before that, after but the briefest run, →

it levels off and spreads to make a swamp

81

sometimes scarce of water in the summer.



‘When she passed that way, the cruel virgin

saw dry land in the middle of the marsh

84

where no one lived and no one tilled the soil.



‘There, to avoid all company, she stopped, →

with only servants, to ply her magic arts.

87

There she lived and left her empty body.



’Later on, the people scattered round about

collected there because it was protected

90

by the marsh on every side.



‘They built the city over those dead bones

and, after her who first had claimed the spot,

93

named it Mantua, with no spells or incantations.



‘Once, its population was more plentiful, →

before the foolishness of Casalodi

96

bore the brunt of Pinamonte’s guile.



‘I charge you, therefore, should you ever hear →

my city’s origin described another way,

99

allow no lie to falsify the truth.’



And I: ‘Master, to me your explanation

is so convincing and so takes my trust

102

that any other tale would seem spent embers.



‘But tell me, among these people who are passing,

if you see any worthy of my notice,

105

for my thoughts keep going back to them alone.’



Then he replied: ‘The one whose beard →

falls from his jowls onto his swarthy shoulders

108

was—when Greece was so deprived of males



‘that the only ones still there were in their cradles—

a soothsayer. At Aulis, along with Calchas,

111

he told the favoring time for setting sail.



‘Eurypylus was his name, and thus he is sung

in certain verses of my lofty tragedy,

114

as you know very well, who know it all.



‘That other, with the skinny shanks, →

was Michael Scot, who truly understood

117

the way to play the game of magic tricks.



’See Guido Bonatti. See Asdente, who now regrets → →

not having worked his leather and his thread—

120

but he repents too late.



‘See the wretched women who gave up needle, →

spool, and spindle to take up fortune-telling,

123

casting spells with images and herbs.



‘But come now, for Cain, with his thorns, →

already stands above the border of both hemispheres

126

and touches the waves below Seville.



‘and recall two nights ago →

the moon, already full, did you no harm,

at any time in the deep wood.’

130

These were his words while we were moving on. →

INFERNO XXI


Thus from one bridge to the next we came →

until we reached its highest point, speaking

3

of things my Comedy does not care to sing.



We stopped to look into the next crevasse

of Malebolge and heard more useless weeping.

6

All I could see was an astounding darkness.



As in the arsenal of the Venetians →

in wintertime they boil the viscous pitch

9

to caulk their unsound ships



because they cannot sail—one rebuilds

his ship, while still another plugs

12

the seams of his, weathered by many a voyage:



one hammers at the stem, another at the stern,

this one makes the oars, that one twists the ropes

15

for rigging, another patches jib and mainsail—



so, not with fire, but by the art of God,

a thick pitch boiled there,

18

sticking to the banks on either side.



I saw the pitch but still saw nothing in it

except the bubbles raised up by the boiling,

21

the whole mass swelling and then settling back.



While I stared fixedly upon the seething pitch,

my leader cried: ‘Look out, look out!’

24

and drew me to him, away from where I stood.



Then I turned like a man, intent

on making out what he must run from,

27

undone by sudden fear,



who does not slow his flight for all his looking back:

just so I caught a glimpse of some dark devil →

30

running toward us up the ledge.



Ah, how ferocious were his looks

and fierce his gesturing,

33

with wings spread wide and nimble feet!



One of his shoulders, which were high and pointed, →

was laden with the haunches of a sinner

36

he held hooked by the tendons of his heels.



From our bridge he said: ‘O Malebranche, →

here is one of Santa Zita’s Elders. →

39

Thrust him under, while I head back for more →



‘to that city, where there’s such a fine supply.

Every man there—except Bonturo—is a swindler. →

42

There money turns a No into a Yeah.’



He flung him down and turned back up

the stony ridge. Never did a mastiff

45

set loose to chase a thief make greater haste.



The sinner sank, then rose again, his face all pitch. →

The demons, under cover of the bridge, cried out:

48

‘This is no place for the Holy Visage!



‘Here you swim a different stroke than in the Serchio! →

Unless you’d like to feel our hooks,

51

don’t let yourself stick out above the pitch.’



Then, with a hundred hooks and more,

they ripped him, crying: ‘Here you must do your dance

54

in secret and pilfer—can you?—in the dark.’



In just the same way cooks command their scullions

to take their skewers and prod the meat down

57

in the cauldron, lest it float back up.



Then my good master said: ‘Squat down →

behind that rock and find some cover

60

so that they do not see that you are here.



‘As for any outrage they may do me,

have no fear. I know this place and had

63

exactly such a scuffle here before.’ →



After he had crossed the bridge

and reached the other bank,

66

he had to show how resolute he was:



With all the rage and uproar →

of dogs that rush upon a beggar—

69

who quickly starts to beg where he has stopped—



they swarmed on him from underneath the bridge

with threatening hooks. But he cried out:

72

‘Wait! Let none of you do harm!



‘Before you grapple at me with your hooks

let one of you come forth to hear me out.

75

Then take counsel, whether to use your claws.’



All cried: ‘Let Malacoda go.’ One moved— →

the rest stood still—and he came forward,

78

grumbling: ‘This won’t do him any good.’



‘Consider, Malacoda,’ said my master, →

‘whether you would see me come this far

81

unstopped by all your hindering



‘without the will of God and favoring fate?

Let us proceed, for it is willed in Heaven

84

that I guide another down this savage way.’



Then his pride was so abashed that he let drop →

the billhook to his feet, saying to the others:

87

‘Enough, let no one touch him.’



And my leader said to me: ‘You there, cowering →

among the broken boulders of the bridge,

90

now you may come back to me in safety.’



At that I stirred and hastened to him.

Then the devils all came surging forward

93

so that I feared they might not keep the truce.



Just so do I recall the troops

afraid to leave Caprona with safe-conduct, →

96

finding themselves among so many enemies.



I drew my body up against my leader

but kept my eyes fixed on their faces,

99

which were far from friendly.



They aimed their hooks, and one said to another: →

‘How about I nick him on the rump?’

102

And the other answered: ‘Sure, let him have one.’



But the demon who was speaking with my leader

turned round at once and said:

105

‘Easy does it, Scarmiglione!’



And then to us: ‘You can’t continue farther →

down this ridge, for the sixth arch

108

lies broken into pieces at the bottom.



‘If you desire to continue on,

then make your way along this rocky ledge.

111

Nearby’s another crag that yields a passage.



‘Yesterday, at a time five hours from now, →

it was a thousand two hundred sixty-six years

114

since the road down here was broken.



‘I’m sending some men of mine along that way →

to see if anyone is out to take the air.

117

Go with them—they won’t hurt you.’



‘Step forward, Alichino, Calcabrina,’ →

he continued, ’and you Cagnazzo,

120

and let Barbariccia lead the squad.



‘Let Libicocco come too, and Draghignazzo,

Cirïatto with his tusks, and Graffiacane,

123

Farfarello, and madcap Rubicante.



‘Have a good look around the boiling glue.

Keep these two safe as far as the next crag →

126

that runs all of a piece above the dens.’



‘Oh, master,’ I said, ‘I don’t like what I see. →

Please, let us find our way without an escort,

129

if you know how. As for me, I do not want one.



‘If you are as vigilant as ever,

don’t you see they grind their teeth

132

while with their furrowed brows they threaten harm?’



And he to me: ‘Don’t be afraid. →

Let them grind on to their hearts’ content—

135

they do it for the stewing wretches.’



Off they set along the left-hand bank, →

but first each pressed his tongue between his teeth

to blow a signal to their leader,

139

and he had made a trumpet of his asshole.

INFERNO XXII


I have seen the cavalry break camp, →

prepare for an attack, make their muster

3

and at times fall back to save themselves.



I have seen outriders in your land,

O Aretines. I have seen raiding-parties,

6

tournaments of teams, hand-to-hand jousts



begun with bells, trumpets, or drums,

with signals from the castle,

9

with summons of our own and those from foreign lands,



but never to such outlandish fanfare

have I seen horsemen move, or infantry,

12

or ship set sail at sign from land or star.



On we went, escorted by ten demons. →

What savage company! But, as they say,

15

‘in church with saints, with guzzlers in the tavern.’



My attention was fixed upon the pitch

to note each detail of this gulch

18

and of the people poaching in it.



Like dolphins, when they arch their backs →

above the water, giving sailors warning

21

to prepare to save their ship,



so from time to time, to ease his pain,

one of the sinners would show his back

24

and, quick as lightning, hide it once again.



And just as in a ditch at water’s edge

frogs squat with but their snouts in sight,

27

their bodies and their legs all hidden,



so were the sinners scattered everywhere.

But they, at the approach of Barbariccia,

30

withdrew back down beneath the boiling.



There I saw—and my heart still shudders at it—

one who lingered, as it can happen

33

that one frog stays while yet another plunges,



and Graffiacane, who was nearest him,

caught a billhook in his pitchy locks

36

and hauled him out, looking like an otter.



By now I knew their names, →

since I had noted these when they were chosen

39

and when they called to one another.



‘Set your claws to work, Rubicante,

see you rip his skin off,’

42

shouted all the accursèd crew together.



And I: ‘Master, if you can do it,

find out the name of this poor wretch

45

caught in the clutches of his enemies.’



My leader got up close beside him

and asked him where he came from. He replied:

48

‘I was born in the kingdom of Navarre. →



‘My mother, who had conceived me by a wastrel—

destroyer of himself and all his goods—

51

put me in service with a man of rank.



‘Then I joined the retinue of worthy Thibaut:

there first I set myself to taking bribes,

54

for which I pay the reckoning in this heat.’



And Ciriatto, from whose jaw curved up

on either side a tusk, like the wild boar’s,

57

made him feel how one of these could rip.



The mouse had fallen in with wicked cats.

But Barbariccia blocked them with his arms →

60

and said: ‘Stand back and let me jab him,’



then turned to face my master:

‘Speak up, if you are eager to learn more,

63

before I let him have a mangling.’



And my leader: ‘Of the other sinners in the pitch, →

tell me, is anyone Italian?’

66

And he: ‘I just now came from one



‘who hailed from near those parts. I wish →

I still were with him in the pitch—

69

then I’d have no fear of hook or claw!’



Then Libicocco said: ‘This is just too much,’ →

caught him with his grapple by the arm

72

and, ripping, gouged out a hunk of flesh.



Draghignazzo, too, wanted to catch him up,

by the legs, at which their captain

75

wheeled round on them with an ugly look.



After their fury had subsided,

my leader seized this chance to ask

78

the one still staring at his wound:



‘Who is the one you mentioned, from whom

you parted so unwisely when you came ashore?’

81

And he replied: ‘It was Fra Gomìta →



‘of Gallura, a vessel full of fraud,

who had his master’s enemies in hand

84

but dealt with them so each one sings his praises.



‘He took their money and discreetly let them off,

as he himself admits. And in his other actions

87

he was no small-time swindler but a king.



’Don Michel Zanche of Logudoro →

keeps company with him and, when speaking

90

of Sardegna, their tongues are never weary.



‘Oh, look at that one there, gnashing his teeth!— →

I would say more, but I’m afraid that demon’s

93

getting set to give my mange a scratching.’



And the great marshal, turning to Farfarello,

who was rolling his eyes, ready to strike,

96

said: ‘Back off, you filthy bird!’



‘If you would care to see or hear,’ →

the emboldened spirit then began again,

99

‘Tuscans or Lombards, I can make some come.



‘But let the Malebranche stand away →

so that the sinners have no fear of vengeance,

102

and, keeping to my place right here,



‘for one of me, I will make seven come

if I whistle, as is our custom

105

when one of us pulls free out of the pitch.’



At this Cagnazzo lifted up his snout and said,

shaking his head: ‘Hear the cunning stunt

108

he has contrived to throw himself back in!’



And he, with artifice in store, replied:

‘I must indeed be cunning if I procure

111

still greater anguish for my friends.’



Alichino couldn’t stand this any more and said,

in opposition to the others: ‘If you dive

114

back in I won’t pursue you on the run—



‘oh no! I’ll beat my wings above the pitch.

Let’s leave the ridge and hide behind the bank.

117

We’ll see if you alone can take us on.’



Now, reader, you shall hear strange sport.

All turned their backs to where the sinner stood,

120

he first who’d most opposed the plan.



The Navarrese chose his moment well,

planted his feet and in a second

123

leaped and escaped from their designs.



At this they all were angry at their blunder, →

but most of all the one whose fault it was,

126

so that he darted up and cried: ‘Now you are caught!’



It did him little good, for even wings

could not catch up with terror: the sinner dove

129

and the devil turned up his breast in flight,



just as the wild duck, when the falcon nears,

dives for the bottom, and the bird of prey

132

must fly back up, angry and outsmarted.



Calcabrina, furious at this trick,

was winging close behind him, eager for the sinner

135

to break away as an excuse to scuffle,



and, since the barrator had vanished,

he turned his claws against his fellow

138

and came to grips with him above the ditch.



But the other was indeed a full-fledged hawk,

fierce with his talons, and the pair of them

141

went tumbling down into the scalding pond.



The heat unclutched them in a moment,

but they had so beglued their wings

144

there was no way to rise above the pitch.



Barbariccia, lamenting with the rest, →

had four of them fly to the other bank,

147

each with his hook in hand, and in no time



on this side and on that they clambered down

to their posts, reaching out their grapples

to the pitch-trapped pair, already cooked to a crust.

151

And that is how we left them in that broil. →

INFERNO XXIII


Silent, alone, and unescorted →

we went on, one in front, the other following,

3

as Friars Minor walk along the roads.



The brawl played out before our eyes →

put me in mind of Aesop’s fable

6

in which he told the tale of frog and mouse,



for ‘issa’ and ‘mo’ are not more like in meaning

than one case and the other, if we compare

9

with circumspection their beginnings and their ends.



Just as one thought issues from another,

so, from the first, another now was born

12

that made me twice as fearful as before.



I thought, ’It’s our fault they have been cheated,

and with such hurt and shame

I’m sure it must enrage them.



‘If rage is added to their malice,

they will pursue us still more cruelly

18

than the hound that sets his fangs into a hare.’



I could feel my scalp go taut with fear →

and kept my thoughts fixed just behind me

21

as I spoke: ‘Master, can’t you quickly



‘hide yourself and me? I am in terror

of the Malebranche; I sense them there behind us,

24

imagine them so clear I almost hear them.’



And he: ‘If I were made of leaded glass →

I could not reflect your outward likeness

27

in less time than I grasp the one inside you.



’Just now your thought commingled with my own,

alike in attitude and aspect,

30

so that of both I’ve formed a single plan.



‘If the slope there to the right allows us

to make our way into the other ditch,

33

we shall escape the chase we both envision.’



Before he finished telling me his plan →

I saw them coming, wings outspread,

36

closing in to catch us.



My leader in a moment snatched me up, →

like a mother who, awakened by the hubbub

39

before she sees the flames that burn right near her,



snatches up her child and flees,

and, more concerned for him than for herself,

42

does not delay to put a shift on.



Down from the rim of that stony bank,

supine, he slid along the sloping rock

45

that forms one border of the next crevasse.



Never did water, as it nears the paddles, →

rush down along the sluices

48

cut through earth to turn a millwheel



more swiftly than my master down that bank,

bearing me along clasped to his breast

51

as if I were his child, not his companion.



No sooner had he touched the bottom with his feet →

than the devils were above us on the ridge.

54

Yet now we had no cause for feeling fear,



for high Providence, which made them

wardens of the fifth crevasse,

57

deprives them of the power to leave it.



Down there we came upon a lacquered people →

who made their round, in tears, with listless steps.

60

They seemed both weary and defeated.



The cloaks they wore cut like the capes →

sewn for the monks at Cluny,

63

had cowls that hung down past their eyes.



Gilded and dazzling on the outside, →

within they are of lead, so ponderous

66

that those imposed by Frederick would seem but straw. →



Oh what a toilsome cloak to wear forever!

Once more we turned to the left, then went along

69

beside them, intent upon their wretched wailing.



Their burden made that weary people

move so slowly we had new companions

72

each time we set one foot before the other.



And I said to my leader: ‘Cast your eyes

this way and that as we walk on.

75

See if you know the names or deeds of any.’



And one of them, having heard my Tuscan speech, →

cried out behind us: ‘Stay your feet,

78

you who hasten through this sullen air.



‘I perhaps can answer what you asked.’

At that my leader turned around to say:

81

‘Wait a moment, then continue at his pace.’



I stopped and noticed two whose looks

showed haste of mind to reach me,

84

but their load and the narrow way detained them.



When they came near they looked at me askance

for a while, without uttering a word,

87

until they turned to one another, saying:



‘The way his throat moves, this one must be alive.

And if they are dead, what gives them the right

90

to go uncovered by the heavy stole?’



and then to me: ‘O Tuscan, who have come

to this assembly of sad hypocrites, →

93

do not disdain to tell us who you are.’



‘In the great city, by the fair river Arno,’

I said to them, ’I was born and raised,

96

and I am here in the body that was always mine.



‘But who are you in whom I see distilled

the misery running down your cheeks in tears?

99

And what is the grief you bear that glitters so?’



And one of them answered: ‘Our golden cloaks

are made of lead, and they’re so dense,

102

like scales we creak beneath their weight. →



‘We were Jovial Friars, born in Bologna. →

My name was Catalano, his, Loderingo. →

105

Your city made the two of us a pair,



‘where usually a single man was chosen,

to keep the peace within, and we were such

108

that all around Gardingo the ruins can be seen.’



I began: ‘O Friars, your evil deeds …’ →

but said no more, for one there caught my eye, →

111

fixed cross-wise to the ground by three short stakes.



Seeing me, he writhed all over,

blowing sighs into his beard,

114

and Fra Catalano, observing this, said:



‘That man you see nailed down

advised the Pharisees it was the better course

117

that one man should be martyred for the people.



’He is stretched out naked, as you see, →

across the path. It is his lot to feel

120

the weight of each who passes.



‘Just so his father-in-law is racked with us →

down here and with the others of the council

123

that was a seed of evil for the Jews.’



I saw that Virgil marveled at the sight →

of this shape stretched as on a cross,

126

so ignoble in his eternal exile.



Then he addressed the friar with these words:

‘May it please you, if it is permitted,

129

to say if on our right there is a passage



‘by which we two might leave this place

without requiring help from some black angels →

132

to pluck us from these depths.’



And he replied: ’Nearer than you hope there lies →

a rocky ridge that crosses all the savage valleys

135

from the farthest circle inward.



‘It has fallen only here and fails to reach across.

You can clamber up the sloping rubble

138

that lies upon the bottom and piles up along the side.’



My leader stood a while, his head bent down, then said:

‘He who rips the sinners in the other ditch

141

misled us in his picture of this place.’



And the friar: ‘At one time in Bologna I heard tell →

of the Devil’s many vices, and I heard

144

he is a liar and the father of all lies.’



At that my leader stalked off with long strides, →

a moment’s look of anger on his face.

And so I left those overburdened souls

148

to follow in the imprints of his cherished feet.

INFERNO XXIV


In that season of the youthful year →

when the sun cools his locks beneath Aquarius

3

and the dark already nears but half the day,



and when the hoarfrost copies out upon the fields

the very image of her snowy sister—

6

although her pen-point is not sharp for long—



the peasant, short of fodder, rises,

looks out, and sees the countryside

9

turned white, at which he slaps his thigh,



goes back indoors, grumbling here and there

like a wretch who knows not what to do,

12

then goes outside again and is restored to hope,



seeing that the world has changed its face

in that brief time, and now picks up his crook

15

and drives his sheep to pasture.



Thus the master caused me to lose heart

when I saw how troubled was his brow

18

and just as quickly came the poultice to the wound,



for no sooner had we reached the broken bridge

than he turned to me with that gentle glance

21

I first saw at the mountain’s foot.



He looked with care upon the ruin, →

took thought, chose a plan of action,

24

then opened out his arms and took me in them.



And like one who reckons as he works,

always planning for what comes next,

27

thus, while raising me to one boulder’s peak,



he searched for yet another crag

and said: ‘Take hold of that one next

30

but test it first to see if it will bear your weight.’



This was no climb for people wearing leaden cloaks. →

Though he was weightless and I was being pushed, →

33

how hard a climb it was from one crag to the other!



Were it not that on this side of the dike

the slope was shorter—I cannot speak for him—

36

I would have given up.



But since all Malebolge inclines →

down to the mouth of the lowest pit,

39

it follows that each valley is constructed



with one side higher than the other.

At last we made it to the point

42

where the outermost stone had broken off.



And there I felt my lungs so sucked of breath

that I could go no farther,

45

but I sat down as quickly as I could.



‘Now must you cast off sloth,’ my master said.

‘Sitting on feather cushions or stretched out

48

under comforters, no one comes to fame.



‘Without fame, he who spends his time on earth →

leaves only such a mark upon the world

51

as smoke does on the air or foam on water.



‘Get to your feet! Conquer this laboring breath

with strength of mind, which wins the battle

54

if not dragged down by body’s weight.



‘There is a longer stair that must be climbed.

It’s not enough to leave these souls behind.

57

If you take my meaning, let it be of use.’



At that I rose, pretending to more breath →

than I had in me, and said:

60

‘Go on then, for I am strong and resolute.’



We labored up a ridge,

rugged, narrow, difficult,

63

and steeper far than was the last.



Not to seem so spent, I talked as I climbed up.

Then, from the next ditch, came a voice →

66

that seemed unfit for forming words.



I could not make out what it said, →

though I was at the crown that arches over,

69

but the one who spoke seemed to be in motion.



Hard as I strained to see, it was too dark

for living eyes to plumb the depths.

72

And so I said: ‘Master, take your way



‘to the next ledge where we can leave this bridge.

From here I make out nothing with my ears

75

nor with my eyes see anything down there.’



‘I give no other answer than to take you,’

he said, ‘for a just request

78

should be followed by the act, in silence.’



We left the bridge at the abutment →

where it comes to rest on that eighth bank.

81

From there the contents of the ditch came into view.



In it I saw a dreadful swarm of serpents, →

of so strange a kind that even now

84

when I remember them it chills my blood.



Let Libya with all her sands no longer boast, →

for though she fosters chelydri, jaculi,

87

phareae, cenchres, and amphisbaena,



she never reared so many venomous pests, →

nor so appalling—not with all of Ethiopia

90

and the lands that lie along the Red Sea coast.



Amid this fearsome and most awful plenty, →

people, naked and in terror, were running

93

without hope of refuge or of heliotrope.



Their hands were tied behind their backs with snakes

that thrust their heads and tails between the legs

96

and joined, knotting themselves in front.



And behold, one of these souls was near our ridge →

when a serpent launched and pierced him through →

99

right where the neck and shoulders join.



Never has ‘o’ nor even ‘i’ been writ so quick →

as he caught fire and burned, turned,

102

in the very act of falling, into ashes.



And as he lay unmade upon the ground,

the dust regathered of its own accord

105

and suddenly he was himself again.



Just, as is attested by great sages,

the phoenix perishes and is reborn →

108

when it approaches its five-hundredth year—



lifelong it feeds on neither grain nor grasses,

but thrives on drops of frankincense and cardamom,

111

while nard and myrrh make up its winding sheet—



and just as one who faints, and knows not why—

whether possessed by devils that pull him down

114

or seized by the sickness that causes men to fall—



rises to his feet, and gazes round,

wholly bewildered by the breathless anguish

117

he has undergone, and as he looks, he sighs,



such did that sinner seem when he had risen.

O how stern it is, the power of God, →

120

hurling such blows as it takes vengeance!



When my leader asked him who he was:

‘From Tuscany I rained down,’ was his answer, →

123

‘not long ago, into this savage gorge.



‘I loved the life of beasts and not of men,

just like the mule I was. I am Vanni Fucci,

126

animal. Pistoia was my fitting den.’



And I to my leader: ‘Tell him not to slip away, →

then ask what sin has thrust him to this depth,

129

for I knew him as a man of blood and rages.’



And the sinner, listening, did not dissemble,

but set his mind and eyes on me,

132

then colored with a wrathful shame →



and said: ‘For you to catch me

in this misery pains me more

135

than when I was taken from the other life.



‘I can’t refuse to answer what you ask.

I am thrust so far below because I stole

138

the lovely ornaments from the sacristy



‘and the blame was wrongly laid upon another.

But, so you take no joy in seeing me this low, →

141

if ever you escape from these dark regions,



‘open your ears to prophecy and hear:

First, Pistoia strips herself of Blacks, →

144

then Florence changes families and fashions.



‘Next Mars draws up a bolt from Val di Magra,

engulfed by torn and threatening clouds,

147

and, with violent and stinging storms,



’on Campo Piceno the battle shall be joined.

The headlong bolt shall rend the clouds,

striking and wounding every White.

151

And this I have told that it may make you grieve.’ →

INFERNO XXV


Then, making the figs with both his thumbs, →

the thief raised up his fists and cried:

3

‘Take that, God! It’s aimed at you!’



From that time on the serpents were my friends, →

for one of them coiled itself around his neck →

6

as if to say, ‘Now you shall speak no more,’



while another enmeshed his arms and held him fast,

knotting itself so tight around his front

9

he could not even twitch his arms.



Ah, Pistoia, Pistoia, why won’t you resolve →

to burn yourself to ashes, cease to be,

12

since you exceed your ancestors in evil?



Through all the gloomy rounds of Hell →

I saw no soul so prideful against God,

15

not even him who toppled from the walls at Thebes.



He ran away without another word.

And then I saw a centaur full of rage →

18

come shouting: ‘Where, where is that unripe soul?’



Maremma does not have as many snakes, →

I think, as he had on his back,

21

from where the human part begins down to the rump.



On his shoulders, at the nape of his neck,

crouched a dragon with its wings spread wide

24

that sets on fire whatever it encounters.



My master said: ‘That is Cacus,

who in the cave beneath the Aventine

27

many times over has made a lake of blood.



‘His road is different from his brothers’

because he stole, with wicked cunning,

30

the herd of cattle he found near at hand.



‘For that his wily ways were ended

beneath the club of Hercules, who struck perhaps

33

a hundred blows, though he felt not the tenth.’



While my master spoke the centaur had run past. →

Below where we were standing, three new souls

36

had neared, although we did not see them



until we heard their shouts: ‘You,

who are you?’ At that he stopped his tale

39

and we gave heed to them alone.



I knew none of them, and yet it happened—

as often happens by some chance—

42

that one had cause to speak another’s name,



asking: ‘What’s become of Cianfa?’ →

And then, to catch my guide’s attention, →

45

I held my finger up from chin to nose.



If, reader, you are slow to credit

what I’m about to tell you, it’s no wonder:

48

I saw it, and I myself can scarce believe it.



While I stood staring, with eyebrows raised, →

a reptile with six legs propelled itself

51

at one of them, and fastened itself to him.



It grabbed his belly with its middle claws,

then with its forepaws held his arms

54

and bit through both his cheeks.



It stretched its hind feet down the other’s thighs,

thrusting its tail between them

57

and curled it up behind, above the buttocks.



Never did clinging ivy fix itself

so tight upon a tree as did that fearsome beast

60

entwine itself around the other’s limbs.



Then they fused together, as if made

of molten wax, mixing their colors

63

so that neither seemed what it had been before,



as over the surface of a scrap of parchment, →

before the advancing flame, a brownish color comes

66

that is not black, yet makes the white die out.



The other two were looking on and each

was shouting: ‘Oh my, Agnello, how you change! →

69

Look, now you are neither two nor one!’ →



The two heads had already been united,

two sets of features blending,

72

both lost in a single face.



Four separate limbs combined to form two arms.

The thighs and calves, the stomach and the chest

75

turned into members never seen before.



All trace of their first aspect was erased

and the unnatural figure seemed both two

78

and none and lumbered off at its slow pace.



As the green lizard beneath the scorching lash →

of dog-day heat, between one hedge and the next,

81

seems lightning as it streaks across the road,



just so appeared—darting toward the bellies →

of the other two—a little fiery reptile,

84

black and livid as a peppercorn.



That part where first we are nourished

it transfixed in one of them

87

and then fell prone before him.



The one transfixed just stared, said nothing.

Indeed, with his feet stock-still, he yawned,

90

as if deep sleep or fever had assailed him.



He and the reptile stared at one another.

Both gave out dense smoke, one from its wound,

93

the other from its mouth. Then their smoke merged.



Let Lucan now fall silent where he tells →

of poor Sabellus and Nasidius,

96

and let him wait to hear what comes forth now!



Let Ovid not speak of Cadmus or Arethusa,

for if his poem turns him into a serpent

99

and her into a fountain, I grudge it not,



for never did he change two natures, face to face,

in such a way that both their forms

102

were quite so quick exchanging substance.



Their corresponding changes went like this: →

the reptile split its tail into a fork

105

and he that was wounded drew his feet together.



First his calves and then his thighs began

to knit so that in but a moment

108

no sign of a division could be seen.



The cloven tail assumed the shapes

the other one was losing, and his skin

111

was turning soft while the other’s hardened.



I saw the man’s arms shrinking toward the armpits

and the brute’s forepaws, which had been short,

114

lengthen, precisely as the other’s dwindled.



Then the hind-paws, twisting together,

became the member that a man conceals,

117

and from his own the wretch had grown two paws.



While the smoke veils one and now the other

with new color and grows hair here

120

and elsewhere strips it off,



one of them rose to his feet, the other fell,

but neither turned aside his baleful glare

123

under which each muzzle changed its shape.



In the one erect it shrank in to the temples,

and, from the excess flesh absorbed,

126

two ears extruded from smooth cheeks.



That which did not recede, the remnant

of that excess, made a nose for the face

129

and gave the lips a proper thickness.



The one prone on the ground shoves out his snout

and draws his ears into his head

132

as a snail draws in its horns,



and his tongue, till now a single thing

and fit for speech, divides, and the other’s

135

forked tongue joins, and the smoke stops.



The soul just now become a brute takes flight,

hissing through the hollow, and the other,

138

by way of speaking, spits after him.



Then he turned his new-made shoulders and he said →

to the third: ‘I want Buoso to run, as I have done,

141

down on all fours along this road.’



Thus I saw the seventh rabble change

and change again, and let the newness of it

144

be my excuse if my pen has gone astray. →



And though my eyes were dazed

and my mind somewhat bewildered,

147

these sinners could not flee so stealthily



but I with ease discerned that Puccio Lameshanks, →

and he alone, of the three companions

in that group, remained unchanged.

151

The other, Gaville, was the one whom you lament. →

INFERNO XXVI


Take joy, oh Florence, for you are so great →

your wings beat over land and sea,

3

your fame resounds through Hell!



Among the thieves, I found five citizens of yours

who make me feel ashamed, and you

6

are raised by them to no great praise.



But if as morning nears we dream the truth, →

it won’t be long before you feel the pain →

9

that Prato, to name but one, desires for you.



Were it already come, it would not be too soon.

But let it come, since come indeed it must,

12

and it will weigh the more on me the more I age.



We left that place and, on those stairs

that turned us pale when we came down, →

15

my leader now climbed back and drew me up.



And as we took our solitary way

among the juts and crags of the escarpment,

18

our feet could not advance without our hands.



I grieved then and now I grieve again →

as my thoughts turn to what I saw,

21

and more than is my way, I curb my powers



lest they run on where virtue fail to guide them,

so that, if friendly star or something better still

24

has granted me its boon, I don’t misuse the gift.



As when a peasant, resting on a hillside— →

in the season when he who lights the world

27

least hides his face from us,



at the hour when the fly gives way to the mosquito—

sees fireflies that glimmer in the valley

30

where perhaps he harvests grapes and ploughs his fields,



with just so many flames the eighth crevasse →

was everywhere aglow, as I became aware

33

once I arrived where I could see the bottom.



And as the one who was avenged by bears →

could see Elijah’s chariot taking flight,

36

when the horses reared and rose to Heaven,



but made out nothing with his eyes

except the flame alone

39

ascending like a cloud into the sky,



so each flame moves along the gullet

of the trench and—though none reveals the theft—

42

each flame conceals a sinner.



Rising to my feet to look, I stood up →

on the bridge. Had I not grasped a jutting crag,

45

I would have fallen in without a shove.



My leader, when he saw me so intent, said:

‘These spirits stand within the flames.

48

Each one is wrapped in that in which he burns.’ →



‘Master,’ I replied, ’I am the more convinced

to hear you say it. That is what I thought,

51

and had it in my mind to ask you this:



‘Who is in the flame so riven at the tip →

it could be rising from the pyre

54

on which Etèocles was laid out with his brother?’



He replied: ‘Within this flame find torment →

Ulysses and Diomed. They are paired

57

in God’s revenge as once they earned his wrath.



’In their flame they mourn the stratagem →

of the horse that made a gateway

60

through which the noble seed of Rome came forth.



‘There they lament the wiles for which, in death,

Deidamìa mourns Achilles still,

63

and there they make amends for the Palladium.’



‘If they can speak within those flames,’ →

I said, ’I pray you, master, and I pray again—

66

and may my prayer be a thousand strong—



‘do not forbid my lingering awhile

until the twin-forked flame arrives.

69

You see how eagerly I lean in its direction.’



And he to me: ‘Your prayer deserves →

much praise. Therefore, I grant it,

72

but on condition that you hold your tongue.



‘Leave speech to me, for I have understood

just what you want. And, since they were Greeks,

75

they might disdain your words.’



Once the flame had neared, when he thought

the time and moment right,

78

I heard my leader speaking in this way:



‘O you who are twinned within a single fire, →

if I have earned your favor while I lived,

81

if I have earned your favor—in whatever measure—



‘when, in the world, I wrote my lofty verses,

then do not move away. Let one of you relate

84

just where, having lost his way, he went to die.’



And the larger horn of that ancient flame

began to murmur and to tremble,

87

like a flame that is worried by the wind.



Then, brandishing its tip this way and that,

as if it were the tongue of fire that spoke,

90

it brought forth a voice and said: ‘When I →



‘took leave of Circe, who for a year and more

beguiled me there, not far from Gaëta,

93

before Aeneas gave that name to it,



‘not tenderness for a son, nor filial duty →

toward my agèd father, nor the love I owed

96

Penelope that would have made her glad,



‘could overcome the fervor that was mine

to gain experience of the world

99

and learn about man’s vices, and his worth.



‘And so I set forth upon the open deep →

with but a single ship and that small band

102

of shipmates who had not deserted me.



‘One shore and the other I saw as far as Spain,

Morocco, the island of Sardegna,

105

and other islands set into that sea.



‘I and my shipmates had grown old and slow

before we reached the narrow strait

108

where Hercules marked off the limits,



‘warning all men to go no farther.

On the right-hand side I left Seville behind,

111

on the other I had left Ceüta.



‘ “O brothers,” I said, “who, in the course →

of a hundred thousand perils, at last

114

have reached the west, to such brief wakefulness



‘ “of our senses as remains to us,

do not deny yourselves the chance to know—

117

following the sun—the world where no one lives.



’ “Consider how your souls were sown: →

you were not made to live like brutes or beasts,

120

but to pursue virtue and knowledge.”



‘With this brief speech I had my companions →

so ardent for the journey

123

I could scarce have held them back.



‘And, having set our stern to sunrise, →

in our mad flight we turned our oars to wings,

126

always gaining on the left.



‘Now night was gazing on the stars that light →

the other pole, the stars of our own so low

129

they did not rise above the ocean floor.



‘Five times the light beneath the moon

had been rekindled and as often been put out

132

since we began our voyage on the deep,



‘when we could see a mountain, distant,

dark and dim. In my sight it seemed

135

higher than any I had ever seen.



‘We rejoiced, but joy soon turned to grief: →

for from that unknown land there came →

138

a whirlwind that struck the ship head-on.



‘Three times it turned her and all the waters →

with her. At the fourth our stern reared up,

the prow went down—as pleased Another—

142

until the sea closed over us.’ →

INFERNO XXVII


The flame now stood erect and still, →

meaning to speak no more, and was departing

3

with the gentle poet’s leave, →



when another flame, coming close behind, →

caused our eyes to fix upon its tip,

6

drawn by the gibberish that came from it.



As the Sicilian bull that bellowed first →

with the cries of him whose instrument

9

had fashioned it—and that was only just—



used to bellow with the victim’s voice

so that, although the bull was made of brass,

12

it seemed transfixed by pain,



thus, having first no course or outlet

through the flame, the mournful words

15

were changed into a language all their own.



But once the words had made their way →

up to the tip, making it flicker

18

as the voice had done when it had formed them,



we heard it say: ‘O you at whom I aim my voice →

and who, just now, said in the Lombard tongue:

21

“Now go your way, I ask you nothing more,”



‘though I’ve arrived, perhaps, a little late,

let it not trouble you to stay and speak with me.

24

Though I am in the flame, as you can see, it irks me not.



‘If you are only a short while fallen →

into this blind world from that sweet land

27

of Italy, from which I bring down all my sins,



‘tell me if Romagna lives in peace or war. →

I came from where the mountains stand between

30

Urbino and the ridge from which the Tiber springs.’



I still stood bending down to hear,

when my leader nudged my side and said:

33

‘It’s up to you to speak—this one is Italian.’ →



And I, who had my answer ready,

without delay began to speak:

36

‘O soul that is hidden from my sight down there,



‘your Romagna is not, and never was, →

free of warfare in her rulers’ hearts.

39

Still, no open warfare have I left behind.



‘Ravenna remains as it has been for years. →

The eagle of Polenta broods over it

42

so that he covers Cervia with his wings.



‘The town that once withstood the lengthy siege,

making of the French a bloody heap,

45

is now again beneath the green claws of the lion.



‘The elder mastiff of Verrucchio and the younger,

who between them had harsh dealing with Montagna,

48

sharpen their teeth to augers in the customary place.



‘The young lion on a field of white,

who rules Lamone’s and Santerno’s cities,

51

changes sides between the summer and the snows.



‘And the city whose flank the Savio bathes:

as she lives between tyranny and freedom,

54

so she lies between the mountain and the plain.



‘But now, I beg you, tell us who you are. →

Be no more grudging than another’s been to you,

57

so may your name continue in the world.’



When the fire had done its roaring for a while,

after its fashion, the point began to quiver

60

this way and that, and then gave breath to this:



‘If I but thought that my response were made →

to one perhaps returning to the world,

63

this tongue of flame would cease to flicker.



‘But since, up from these depths, no one has yet

returned alive, if what I hear is true,

66

I answer without fear of being shamed.



‘A warrior was I, and then a corded friar, →

thinking, cinctured so, to make amends.

69

And surely would my hopes have come to pass



‘but for the Great Priest—the devil take him!— →

who drew me back to my old ways.

72

And I would like to tell you how and why.



‘While I still kept the form in flesh and bones

my mother gave me, my deeds were not

75

a lion’s but the actions of a fox. →



‘Cunning stratagems and covert schemes,

I knew them all, and was so skilled in them

78

my fame rang out to the far confines of the earth.



‘When I saw I had reached that stage of life →

when all men ought to think

81

of lowering sail and coiling up the ropes,



‘I grew displeased with what had pleased me once. →

Repentant and shriven, I became a friar.

84

And woe is me! it would have served.



‘But he, Prince of the latter-day Pharisees, →

engaged in battle near the Lateran

87

and not with either Saracen or Jew,



‘for all his enemies were Christian—

not one of them had gone to conquer Acre

90

or traffic in the Sultan’s lands—



‘paid no heed, for his part, to the highest office

or his holy orders, nor, for mine,

93

to the cord that used to keep its wearers lean.



‘As Constantine once had Sylvester summoned →

from Soracte to cure his leprous sores,

96

so this man called on me to be his doctor



‘and cure him of the fever of his pride.

He asked me for advice, but I kept silent

99

because his words were like a drunkard’s words.



‘And then he spoke again: “Let not your heart mistrust:

I absolve you here and now if you will teach me

102

how I can bring Praeneste to the ground. →



‘ “I have the power, as well you know, to lock →

and unlock Heaven, because the keys are two

105

for which the pope before me had no care.”



‘His threatening tactics brought me to the point →

at which the worse course seemed the one of silence.

108

And so I said: “Father, since you cleanse me



‘ “of the sin that I must even now commit:

Promising much with scant observance

111

will seal your triumph on the lofty throne.”



‘The moment I was dead, Francis came for me. →

But one of the dark Cherubim cried out:

114

“No, wrong me not by bearing that one off.



‘ “He must come down to serve among my minions

because he gave that fraudulent advice. →

117

From then till now I’ve dogged his footsteps.



‘ “One may not be absolved without repentance, →

nor repent and wish to sin concurrently—

120

a simple contradiction not allowed.”



‘Oh, wretch that I am, how I shuddered

when he seized me and said: “Perhaps

123

you didn’t reckon I’d be versed in logic.”



‘He carried me to Minos, who coiled his tail →

eight times around his scaly back

126

and, having gnawed it in his awful rage,



‘said: “Here comes a sinner for the thieving fire.”

And so, just as you see me, I am damned, →

129

cloaked as I am. And as I go, I grieve.’



Once he had brought his words to this conclusion,

the weeping flame departed,

132

twisting and tossing its pointed horn.



We continued on our way, my guide and I,

over the ridge and up the arch that spans

the ditch where those are paid their due

136

who, for disjoining, gather up their load.

INFERNO XXVIII


Who, even in words not bound by meter, →

and having told the tale many times over,

3

could tell the blood and wounds that I saw now?



Surely every tongue would fail,

for neither thought nor speech

6

has the capacity to hold so much.



Could all the wounded troops again assemble: →

first from Apulia, land laid low by war,

9

who grieved for their lost blood →



shed by the Trojans, then all those

of the long war, whose corpses were despoiled

12

of piles of rings—as Livy writes, who does not err— →



together with the ones who felt the agony of blows →

fighting in the fields against Guiscard,

15

and those whose bones still lie in heaps →



at Ceperano, where each Apulian played it false,

and those near Tagliacozzo, →

18

where old Alardo conquered without force of arms:



and should one show his limb pierced through, →

another his, where it has been cut off,

21

it would be nothing to the ninth pit’s filth.



No cask ever gapes so wide for loss →

of mid- or side-stave as the soul I saw

24

cleft from the chin right down to where men fart.



Between the legs the entrails dangled. I saw

the innards and the loathsome sack

27

that turns what one has swallowed into shit.



While I was caught up in the sight of him,

he looked at me and, with his hands, ripped apart

30

his chest, saying: ‘See how I rend myself,



‘see how mangled is Mohammed!

Ahead of me proceeds Alì, in tears, →

33

his face split open from his chin to forelock.



‘And all the others whom you see

sowed scandal and schism while they lived, →

36

and that is why they here are hacked asunder.



‘A devil’s posted there behind us →

who dresses us so cruelly,

39

putting each of this crew again to the sword



‘as soon as we have done our doleful round.

For all our wounds have closed

42

when we appear again before him.



‘But who are you to linger on the ridge?— →

perhaps you put off going to the torment

45

pronounced on your own accusation.’



‘Death does not have him yet nor does his guilt

lead him to torment,’ replied my master,

48

‘but to give him greater knowledge



‘I, who am dead indeed, must shepherd him

from circle to circle, through this Hell down here.

51

And this is as true as that I speak to you.’



On hearing this, more than a hundred souls

halted in the ditch to stare at me

54

in wonder, each forgetful of his pain.



‘You, who perhaps will shortly see the sun, →

warn Fra Dolcino to provide himself—

57

unless he’d like to join me here quite soon—



‘with stocks of victuals, lest the siege of snow

hand the Novarese the victory

60

not otherwise so easy to attain.’



One foot raised, halted in mid-stride, →

Mohammed spoke these words,

63

then setting down that foot, went on his way.



Another, with his throat pierced through

and nose hacked off just where the brows begin, →

66

and only one ear left upon his head,



stopped with the rest of them to gape in wonder

and, before the others did, opened his windpipe, →

69

scarlet on the skin side as it was,



to say: ‘O you whom guilt does not condemn →

and whom I saw above in Italy,

72

if in your likeness I am not deceived,



‘should you ever see that gentle plain again

that slopes from Vercelli down to Marcabò,

75

for Pier da Medicina spare a thought.



‘And let the two chief men of Fano know, →

both messer Guido and Angiolello,

78

that, unless our foresight here is vain,



‘through a brutal tyrant’s treachery

near La Cattolica they shall be heaved

81

out of their ship with weights to hold them down.



‘Between the islands of Cyprus and Majorca →

Neptune never witnessed so terrible a crime,

84

whether one committed by pirates or by Greeks.



‘That traitor, who sees through one eye only →

and rules the city that another down here with me

87

would take delight in never having seen,



‘will have the men of Fano come to parley

and he will so deal with them that, to ply →

90

Focara’s wind, they’ll need no vows or prayers.’



And I: ‘Point out to me and make him known, →

if you would have me carry news of you above,

93

the one to whom that city’s sight was bitter.’



Then he laid his hand upon the jaw

of one of his companions, pried his lips apart,

96

and cried: ‘Here he is, but he won’t speak. →



‘Banished, he quenched the doubt in Caesar,

affirming that, to a man prepared,

99

delay was always harmful.’



Ah, how distressed he seemed to me,

with his tongue sliced off so deep in his throat,

102

Curio, who had been so bold in speech!



And then another whose hands had been chopped off, →

raising his stumps up in the murky air

105

so that the blood from them befouled his face,



cried out: ‘Surely you’ll remember Mosca also,

who said, alas: “A done deed finds its purpose.”

108

For Tuscany, that was an evil seed.’



‘And death to your own stock,’ I added then. →

At that, one sorrow piled upon another,

111

he made off, like a man berserk with grief.



But I stayed on to watch the troop

and saw a thing I would be loath

114

to mention without further proof,



were I not comforted by conscience, →

the bosom friend that fortifies a man

117

beneath the armor of an honest heart.



I truly saw, and seem to see it still,

a headless body make its way

120

like all the others in that dismal flock.



And by its hair he held his severed head

swinging in his hand as if it were a lantern.

123

The head stared at us and said: ‘Oh, woe!’



Of himself he made himself a lamp,

and they were two in one and one in two.

126

How this can be He knows who so ordains it.



When he was just at the foot of the bridge

he raised his arm high and, with it, that head,

129

so as to make his words sound more distinct:



‘You, who view the dead with breath yet in your body, →

look upon my grievous punishment.

132

Is any other terrible as this?



‘So you may carry back the news of me,

know I am Bertran de Born, the one

135

who urged the young king on with bad advice.



‘Father and son I set to enmity.

Ahithophel stirred no worse ill between

138

Absalom and David with his wicked goading.



‘Because I severed persons thus conjoined,

severed, alas, I carry my own brain

from its starting-point here in my body.

142

In me you may observe fit punishment.’ →

Griffolino of Arezzo: We both are; who are you?

94–96

Virgil: I lead this living man through hell

97–108

they are thunderstruck at such a presence; Virgil’s advice to Dante; Dante’s promise of fame

109–120

Dante: the French are not as vain as the Sienese

124–135

Capocchio (ironically): Sienese exceptions

136–139

Capocchio’s own sins in alchemy





INFERNO XXIX


The many people and their ghastly wounds →

did so intoxicate my eyes

3

that I was moved to linger there and weep.



But Virgil said: ‘What are you staring at? →

Why is your gaze so fixed upon the depths

6

that hold those mournful, mutilated shades?



‘You have not done so at the other pits.

In case you plan to count the sinners one by one, →

9

think: this hollow circles twenty-two miles round.



‘The moon already lies beneath our feet. →

The time we are allotted soon expires →

12

and there is more to see than you see here.’



‘Had you understood,’ I was quick to answer, →

‘the reason for my close inspection,

15

perhaps you would have let me stay there longer.’



All the while my guide was moving on,

with me, intent on my reply, behind him.

18

And then I added: ‘Within that hole



‘where I had fixed my gaze, I do believe I saw

someone of my own blood lament

21

the sin that costs so dear down there.’



Then the master said: ‘Trouble your mind →

no more because of him.

24

Turn it to other things and let him be,



‘for I saw him there below the bridge,

pointing his finger at you, fierce with threats,

27

and I heard him called Geri del Bello.



‘Just then you were so thoroughly engrossed

in him who once was lord of Hautefort

30

you did not glance that way before your kinsman left.’



‘O my leader, the violent death he died, →

for which no vengeance has been taken yet,’

33

I said, ‘by any person partner to his shame,



‘made him indignant. That is why he went away

without addressing me—or so I think—

36

and why he’s made me pity him the more.’



Thus we continued talking till we reached →

the first point on the ridge that could have shown

39

the next pit’s bottom, had there been more light.



When we stood above the final cloister →

of Malebolge and all of its lay brothers

42

became discernible to us,



strange arrows of lament, their shafts,

with pity at their tips, pierced me,

45

so that I pressed my hands against my ears.



If the contagion of every hospital →

in Valdichiana, from July until September,

48

and in the Maremma and Sardegna, were amassed



in one malarial ditch, just such suffering

was in that place. And from it rose

51

the stench of festering limbs.



We came down, always to our left, and reached →

the last bank of the lengthy crag.

54

And then my eyes could have a better view →



into the pit, there where the minister

of God on high, unerring justice, punishes

57

the counterfeiters whom she here records.



I think it could have been no greater sorrow →

to see the people of Aegina stricken,

60

with such corruption in the very air



that every animal, even the smallest worm,

perished, and, later, as the poets hold for certain,

63

these ancient people were restored to life,



hatched from the eggs of ants—

no greater sorrow, than in that somber valley

66

to see those spirits, heaped on one another, languishing.



Some lay upon the bellies or the backs

of others, still others dragged themselves

69

on hands and knees along that gloomy path.



Step by step we went ahead in silence,

looking and listening to the stricken spirits,

72

who could not raise their bodies from the ground.



Two I saw seated, propped against each other →

as pans are propped to warm before the fire,

75

each of them blotched with scabs from head to foot.



And never did I see a stable-boy,

with his master waiting, nor youth whose chore

78

keeps him from sleep, ply his curry-comb



more hurriedly than each one clawed his nails

across his skin because of that mad itch,

81

which knows no other remedy,



and their nails tore off those scabs

as a knife strips scales from bream

84

or other fish with even larger scales.



‘You there, stripping off your coat of mail,’ →

began my leader, addressing one of them,

87

‘and sometimes making pincers of your fingers,



‘tell us whether, among those gathered here,

any are Italian, so may your nails

90

last you in this task for all eternity.’



‘We whom you see so blasted are Italian,’

answered one of them, through his tears,

93

‘but who are you, that you inquire of us?’



And my leader: ‘I am one who makes his way

down with this living man from ledge to ledge.

96

And my intention is to show him Hell.’



They stopped propping one another up

and each one, trembling, turned in my direction,

99

as others did who’d overheard those words.



The good master drew up close to me,

saying, ‘Ask them what you will.’

102

And I began, since this had been his wish:



‘So that your memory may not fade away

from minds of men in the world above

105

but live on yet for many suns to come,



‘tell me who you are, and where you hail from.

Do not let your foul and sickening torment

108

keep you from telling me your names.’



And one of them replied: ‘I was of Arezzo. →

Albero of Siena had me burned alive.

111

But what I died for does not bring me here.



‘It is true I said to him in jest:

“I do know how to rise into the air and fly!”

114

And he, who had the will but not the wit,



‘asked me to show him how. And just because

I failed to make him Daedalus, he had me set

117

on fire by one who took him as his son.



‘But Minos, incapable of error,

damned me to the last of these ten ditches

120

for the alchemy I practiced in the world.’



And I said to the poet: ‘Were people ever →

quite so fatuous as are the Sienese?

123

Why, not even the French can match them!’



Whereupon the other leper, hearing me, →

replied: ‘Except, of course for Stricca—

126

he knew how to moderate his spending—



‘and for Niccolò—the first one to devise

a costly use for cloves,

129

there in the garden where such seeds take root—



‘and for that band in whose company

Caccia d’Asciano squandered his vineyards

132

and his fields, and Abbagliato showed his wit.



‘But, to let you know who’s in your camp

against the Sienese, look close at me

135

so that my face itself may answer you.



‘You will see I am the shade of Capocchio, →

who altered metal by means of alchemy.

And, if you are the man I take you for,

139

you will recall how good an ape I was of nature.’

INFERNO XXX


Once when Juno, furious with Semele, →

vented her rage against the house of Thebes,

3

as she had done on more than one occasion,



Athamas went so raving mad that when he saw

his wife come near with both their children,

6

holding one on this arm, one on that,



he shouted: “Let’s spread the nets so I can trap

the lioness with her cubs as they go past!”

9

Then he reached out and with pitiless claws



he seized the one who was called Learchus,

whirled him round and dashed him on a rock.

12

At that she drowned herself with her other burden.



And when Fortune had subdued the haughty, →

all-daring spirit of the Trojans,

15

so that both king and kingdom were brought low,



Hecuba—wretched, sorrowing, a captive—

when she saw Polyxena slaughtered and,

18

grieving woman, when she saw



Polydorus lying dead upon the shore,

went mad and started barking like a dog,

21

so greatly had her grief deranged her mind.



But no Theban crazed with rage— →

or Trojan—did ever seem as cruel

24

in rending beasts, much less human parts,



as did two pallid, naked shades I saw,

snapping their jaws as they rushed up

27

like swine charging from an opened sty.



The one came at Capocchio, set its tusks →

into his neck, then dragged him

30

so his belly scraped the rock-hard ground.



And the Aretine, who stood there, trembling,

said to me: ‘That demon’s Gianni Schicchi,

33

and in his rabid rage he mauls the others.’



‘Oh,’ I said, ‘so may that other not fix

its teeth in you, be kind enough to tell me

36

just who it is before it runs away.’



And he answered: ‘That is the ancient soul →

of wicked Myrrha, who became enamored

39

of her father with more than lawful love.



‘She contrived to sin with him

by taking on another person’s shape,

42

as did that other, eager to decamp, →



‘to gain the queen mule of the herd,

take on the shape of Buoso Donati,

45

drawing up a will and giving it due form.’



When those two frenzied shades, on whom →

I’d fixed my eyes, had hurried off,

48

I turned to look at others born for sorrow.



One I saw, fashioned like a lute— →

had he been sundered at the groin

51

from the joining where a man goes forked.



The heavy dropsy, which afflicts the body →

with its ill-digesting humor

54

so that the face and belly do not match,



forced his lips to draw apart

as a person parched with hectic fever curls

57

one lip to his chin and twists the other up.



‘O you who go unpunished here—I know not why— →

through this world of misery,’

60

he said, ‘behold and then consider



‘the suffering of Master Adam.

Alive, I had in plenty all I wanted.

63

And now I crave a single drop of water!



‘The streams that, in the Casentino, →

run down along green hillsides to the Arno,

66

keeping their channels cool and moist,



‘flow before my eyes forever, and not in vain,

because their image makes me thirst still more

69

than does the malady that wastes my features.



‘The rigid justice that torments me

employs the landscape where I sinned

72

to make my sighs come faster.



‘In those parts lies Romena, where I forged

the coinage stamped with John the Baptist.

75

For that I left my body burned above.



‘If I could only see down here the wretched souls →

of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother,

78

I’d not give up that sight for Fonte Branda.



‘One of them is here with us already, →

if the furious shades who move about don’t lie.

81

What good is that to me whose limbs are bound?



‘If I were only light enough to budge →

a single inch each hundred years,

84

I would by now have started on my way



‘to seek him out in this pit’s bloated shapes,

even though it runs eleven miles around

87

and spreads not less than half a mile across.



‘It is their fault that I have such companions, →

for it was they who made me strike the florins

90

that held three carats’ worth of dross.’



And I to him: ‘Who are these two wretches

who steam as wet hands do in winter

93

and lie so very near you on your right?’



‘I found them when I rained into this trough,’

he said, ‘and even then they did not move about,

96

nor do I think they will for all eternity.



‘One is the woman who lied accusing Joseph, →

the other is false Sinon, the lying Greek from Troy.

99

Putrid fever makes them reek with such a stench.’



And one of them, who took offense, perhaps →

at being named so vilely, hit him

102

with a fist right on his rigid paunch.



It boomed out like a drum. Then Master Adam,

whose arm seemed just as sturdy,

105

used it, striking Sinon in the face,



saying: ‘Although I cannot move about

because my legs are heavy,

108

my arm is loose enough for such a task.’



To which the other answered: ‘When they put you

to the fire, your arm was not so nimble,

111

though it was quick enough when you were coining.’



And the dropsied one: ‘Well, that is true,

but you were hardly such a truthful witness

114

when you were asked to tell the truth at Troy.’



‘If I spoke falsely, you falsified the coin,’ →

said Sinon, ‘and I am here for one offense alone,

117

but you for more than any other devil!’



‘You perjurer, keep the horse in mind,’ →

replied the sinner with the swollen paunch,

120

‘and may it pain you that the whole world knows.’



‘And may you suffer from the thirst,’ the Greek replied,

‘that cracks your tongue, and from the fetid humor

123

that turns your belly to a hedge before your eyes!’



Then the forger: ‘And so, as usual,

your mouth gapes open from your fever.

126

If I am thirsty, and swollen by this humor, →



‘you have your hot spells and your aching head.

For you to lick the mirror of Narcissus

129

would not take much by way of invitation.’



I was all intent in listening to them,

when the master said: ‘Go right on looking →

132

and it is I who’ll quarrel with you.’



When I heard him speak to me in anger

I turned and faced him with a shame

135

that circles in my memory even now.



As a man who dreams that he is being harmed →

and, even as he dreams, hopes he is dreaming,

138

longing for what is, as though it weren’t—



so it was with me, deprived of speech:

I longed to seek his pardon—and all the while

141

I did so without knowing that I did.



‘Less shame would cleanse a greater fault than yours,’ →

my master said, ‘and that is why

144

you may set down the load of such remorse.



‘Do not forget I’m always at your side

should it fall out again that fortune take you

where people are in wrangles such as this.

148

For the wish to hear such things is base.’

INFERNO XXXI


The same tongue that had stung me →

so that both my cheeks turned red,

3

had also brought my cure,



just as the spear of Achilles and his father—

so I have heard it told—would be the cause

6

first of a painful, then a welcome, gift.



We turned our backs upon that dismal valley, →

first climbing up the bank that circles it,

9

then crossing over, while speaking not a word.



Here it was less than night and less than day—

I could not see too far ahead.

12

But I heard a horn-blast that would have made



the loudest thunderclap seem faint.

To find its source I turned my eyes

15

back to the place from which the din had come.



After the woeful rout when Charlemagne →

had lost his holy band of knights,

18

Roland did not sound so terrible a blast.



I had not looked that way for long →

when I saw what seemed a range of lofty towers,

21

and I said: ‘Master, tell me, what city is this?’



And he to me: ‘Because you try to pierce

the darkness from too far away,

24

it follows that you err in your perception.



‘When you are nearer, you will understand

how much your eyesight is deceived by distance.

27

Therefore, push yourself a little harder.’



Then with affection he took me by the hand →

and said: ‘Before we travel farther,

30

and so the fact may seem to you less strange,



‘you should be told: these are not towers,

but giants and, from the navel down,

33

each stands behind the bank that rings the pit.’



As, when the mist is lifting, →

little by little we discern things

36

hidden in the air made thick by fog,



so, when my eyes saw through the heavy dark

and I got nearer to the brink,

39

error left me and fear came in its place.



For, as all around her ring of walls →

Monteriggioni is crowned with towers,

42

so at the cliff-edge that surrounds the pit



loomed up like towers half the body bulk

of horrifying giants, those whom Jove

45

still threatens from the heavens when he thunders.



Now I could discern the face of one,

his chest and shoulders, a portion of his paunch,

48

and, hanging at his sides, his arms.



Surely nature did well when she renounced →

the craft of making creatures such as these,

51

depriving Mars of such practitioners.



If she does not repent her elephants

and whales, when one reviews the matter closely

54

she will be found more cautious and more just.



For when the power of thought

is coupled with ill will and naked force

57

there is no refuge from it for mankind.



His face appeared to me as long and broad →

as is, in Rome, the pine cone at St. Peter’s,

60

his other parts as large in like degree,



so that the bank, which hid him like an apron

from his middle downwards, still showed

63

so much of him above that quite in vain



three Frieslanders might boast of having reached

his hair. For I saw thirty spans of him

66

beneath the place where men make fast their cloaks.



‘Raphèl maì amècche zabì almi,’ →

the savage mouth, for which no sweeter

69

psalms were fit, began to shout. →



And, in response, my leader: ‘You muddled soul, →

stick to your horn! Vent yourself with that

72

when rage or other passion takes you.



‘Search at your neck, you creature of confusion,

and you will find the rope that holds the horn

75

aslant your mammoth chest.’



Then he to me: ‘He is his own accuser.

This is Nimrod, because of whose vile plan

78

the world no longer speaks a single tongue.



‘Let us leave him and not waste our speech,

for every language is to him as his

81

to others, and his is understood by none.’



Then, turning to our left, we continued

with our journey. A bowshot farther on

84

we found the next one, bigger and more savage. →



Now who had plied his craft to bind him so

I cannot say, but his right arm

87

was bound behind him, the other one in front,



by chains that from the neck down held him fixed.

They wound five times around his bulk

90

on the part of him that we could see.



‘This prideful spirit chose to test his strength →

against almighty Jove,’ my leader said,

93

‘and this is his reward.



‘He is Ephialtes. He joined the great assault

when giants put the gods in fear.

96

Those arms he brandished he can move no more.’



And I to him: ‘If it is allowed, →

I’d like to see with my own eyes

99

Briareus and his immeasurable bulk.’



He replied: ‘It is Antaeus you shall see.

He is close by, he speaks, he is not fettered.

102

And he shall set us down into the very depth of sin.



‘The one you want to see is farther on,

in fetters also, shaped like this one here,

105

except that from his looks he seems more fierce.’



Never did mighty earthquake shake a tower

with such great speed and force

108

as Ephialtes shook himself at that. →



Then more than ever I was afraid of dying:

my fear alone would have sufficed to bring it on,

111

had I not noted how tightly he was bound.



Going farther on, we came upon Antaeus.

Without the added measure of his head, →

114

he stood a full five ells above the pit.



‘O you, who—in the fateful valley →

that made Scipio an heir to glory,

117

when Hannibal with all his men displayed their backs—



‘you, who took as prey a thousand lions,

and by whose strength, it seems some do believe,

120

had you been at the war on Heaven with your brethren,



‘the sons of earth would have prevailed—

pray set us down, do not disdain to do so,

123

upon Cocytus, shackled by the cold.



‘Don’t make us go to Tityus or Typhon.

This man can give what everyone here longs for. →

126

Therefore bend down and do not curl your lip.



‘He still can make you famous in the world,

because he lives, and hopes for years of living,

129

if Grace does not recall him sooner than his time.’



Thus spoke the master. The other was quick

to reach out with his hands—the mighty grip

132

once felt by Hercules—and seized my guide.



Virgil, when he felt himself secured, said:

‘Here, let me take hold of you!’

135

Then he made a single bundle of himself and me.



As when one sees the tower called Garisenda →

from underneath its leaning side, and then a cloud

138

passes over and it seems to lean the more,



thus did Antaeus seem to my fixed gaze

as I watched him bend—that was indeed a time

141

I wished that I had gone another road.



Even so, he set us gently on the bottom →

that swallows Lucifer with Judas.

Nor in stooping did he linger →

145

but, like a ship’s mast rising, so he rose.

INFERNO XXXII


If I had verses harsh enough and rasping →

as would befit this dismal hole

3

upon which all the other rocks weigh down,



more fully would I press out the juice

of my conception. But, since I lack them,

6

with misgiving do I bring myself to speak.



It is no enterprise undertaken lightly—

to describe the very bottom of the universe—

9

nor for a tongue that still cries ‘mommy’ and ‘daddy.’



But may those ladies who aided Amphion →

to build the walls of Thebes now aid my verse,

12

that the telling be no different from the fact.



O you misgotten rabble, worse than all the rest, →

who fill that place so hard to speak of,

15

better had you here been sheep or goats!



When we were down in that ditch’s darkness, →

well below the giant’s feet,

18

my gaze still drawn by the wall above us,



I heard a voice say: ‘Watch where you walk. →

Step so as not to tread upon our heads,

21

the heads of wretched, weary brothers.’



At that I turned to look about. →

Under my feet I saw a lake

24

so frozen that it seemed more glass than water.



Never in winter did the Austrian Danube →

nor the far-off Don, under its frigid sky,

27

cover their currents with so thick a veil



as I saw there. For had Tambernic fallen on it,

or Pietrapana, the ice would not

30

have creaked, not even at the edge.



And as frogs squat and croak, →

their snouts out of the water, in the season

33

when peasant women often dream of gleaning,



so shades, ashen with cold, were grieving, trapped

in ice up to the place the hue of shame appears,

36

their teeth a-clatter like the bills of storks.



Downturned were all their faces, their mouths →

gave witness to the cold, while from their eyes

39

came testimony of their woeful hearts.



I gazed around a while; then I looked down

and saw two shades so shackled to each other

42

their two heads’ hair made but a single skein.



‘Tell me, you with chests pressed close,’ I said,

‘who are you?’ They strained their necks,

45

and, when they had raised their faces,



their eyes, till then moist only to the rims, →

dripped tears down to their lips, and icy air

48

then froze those tears—and them to one another.



Clamp never gripped together board to board

so tight, at which such anger overcame them

51

they butted at each other like two rams.



And one of the others, who’d lost both ears

to the cold, and kept his face averted, said:

54

‘Why do you reflect yourself so long in us? →



‘If you would like to know who these two are,

the valley out of which Bisenzio flows

57

belonged once to their father, Albert, and to them.



‘From a single womb they sprang, and though you seek

throughout Caïna, you will find no shade

60

more fit to be fixed in aspic,



‘not him whose breast and shadow were pierced

by a single blow from Arthur’s hand,

63

nor Focaccia, nor the one whose head so blocks



‘my view that I cannot see past him

and whose name was Sassol Mascheroni—

66

if you are Tuscan you know well who he was.



‘And, so you coax no further words from me,

know that I was Camiscion de’ Pazzi,

69

and I await Carlino for my exculpation.’



After that I saw a thousand faces purple →

with the cold, so that I shudder still—

72

and always will—when I come to a frozen ford.



Then, while we made our way toward the center, →

where all things that have weight converge,

75

and I was shivering in the eternal chill,



if it was will or fate or chance

I do not know, but, walking among the heads,

78

I struck my foot hard in the face of one.



Wailing, he cried out: ‘Why trample me? →

Unless you come to add to the revenge

81

for Montaperti, why pick on me?’



And I: ‘Master, would you wait for just a moment →

so that I may resolve a doubt about this person.

84

And then I’ll make what haste you like.’



My leader stopped, and I said to the shade,

who was still shouting bitter curses:

87

‘And who are you, so to reproach another?’ →



‘No, who are you to go through Antenora,’

he answered, ‘buffeting another’s cheeks?

90

Were I alive, this still would be an outrage.’



‘Well, I’m alive,’ I said, ‘and if it’s fame you seek,

it might turn out to your advantage

93

if I put your name among the others I have noted.’



And he: ‘I long for just the opposite.

Take yourself off and trouble me no more—

96

you ill know how to flatter at this depth.’



Then I grabbed him by the scruff of the neck

and said: ‘Either you name yourself

99

or I’ll leave you without a single hair.’



And he: ‘You can peel me bald and I

won’t tell you who I am, nor give a hint,

102

even if you jump upon my head a thousand times.’



I now had his hair twisted in my hand

and had already plucked a tuft or two,

105

while he howled on, keeping his eyes cast down,



when another cried: ‘What ails you, Bocca?

Isn’t it enough, making noise with your jaws,

108

without that howling too? What devil’s at you?’



‘Now you no longer need to say a word,

vile traitor,’ said I, ‘to your shame

111

shall I bring back true news of you.’



‘Be off,’ he answered, ‘and tell what tale you will.

But don’t be silent, if you escape from here, →

114

about the one whose tongue was now so nimble.



‘Here he laments the Frenchmen’s silver.

“I saw him of Duera,” you can say,

117

“there where they set the sinners out to cool.”



‘And if someone were to ask you: “Who else was there?”

beside you is the one from Beccherìa—

120

Florence sawed his throat in two.



‘I think Gianni de’ Soldanier is farther on,

with Ganelon and Tebaldello,

123

who opened up Faenza while it slept.’



We had left him behind when I took note →

of two souls so frozen in a single hole

126

the head of one served as the other’s hat.



As a famished man will bite into his bread, →

the one above had set his teeth into the other

129

just where the brain’s stem leaves the spinal cord.



Tydeus gnawed the temples of Melanippus

with bitter hatred just as he was doing

132

to the skull and to the other parts.



‘O you, who by so bestial a sign →

show loathing for the one whom you devour,

135

tell me why,’ I said, ‘and let the pact be this: →



‘if you can give just cause for your complaint,

then I, knowing who you are and what his sin is,

may yet requite you in the world above,

139

if that with which I speak does not go dry.’

INFERNO XXXIII


He raised his mouth from his atrocious meal, →

that sinner, and wiped it on the hair

3

of the very head he had been ravaging.



Then he began: ‘You ask me to revive →

the desperate grief that racks my heart

6

even in thought, before I tell it.



‘But if my words shall be the seeds that bear

infamous fruit to the traitor I am gnawing, →

9

then you will see me speak and weep together. →



‘I don’t know who you are, nor by what means

you have come down here, but when I listen to you speak, →

12

it seems to me you are indeed from Florence.



‘Take note that I was Count Ugolino,

and he Archbishop Ruggieri. Let me

15

tell you why I’m such a neighbor to him.



‘How, as consummation of his malicious schemes,

after I’d lodged my trust in him, he had me seized

18

and put to death, there is no need to tell.



‘But when you learn what you cannot have heard—

that is to say, the cruelty of my death— →

21

then you shall know if he has wronged me.



‘A little spyhole in the Mew, which now →

on my account is called the Tower of Hunger,

24

where others yet shall be imprisoned,



‘had through its opening shown me several moons,

when, in a dreadful dream, →

27

the veil was rent, and I foresaw the future.



‘This man appeared to be the lord and master, →

hunting the wolf and wolfcubs on the mountain

30

that hides Lucca from the sight of Pisans.



‘Along with well-trained hounds, lean and eager,

he had ranged in his front rank

33

Gualandi, Sismondi, and Lanfranchi.



‘Father and sons, after a brief pursuit,

seemed to be flagging, and it seemed to me I saw

36

the flesh torn from their flanks by sharp incisors.



‘When I awoke before the dawn of day →

I heard my children, in that prison with me,

39

weep in their sleep and ask for bread.



‘You are cruel indeed, thinking what my heart →

foretold, if you remain untouched by grief,

42

and if you weep not, what can make you weep?



‘Now they were awake, and the hour drew near

at which our food was brought to us.

45

Each of us was troubled by his dream. →



‘Down below I heard them nailing shut →

the entry to the dreadful tower. I looked

48

my children in the face, without a word.



‘I was so turned to stone inside I did not weep. →

But they were weeping, and my little Anselm

51

said: “You look so strange, father, what’s wrong?”



‘Even then I shed no tear, and made no answer

all that day, and all the night that followed

54

until the next day’s sun came forth upon the world.



‘As soon as some few rays had made their way

into the woeful prison, and I discerned

57

four other faces stamped with my expression,



‘the sorrow of it made me gnaw my hands. →

And they, imagining I was doing this

60

from hunger, rose at once, saying:



‘ “Father, we would suffer less

if you would feed on us: you clothed us

63

in this wretched flesh—now strip it off.”



‘Then, not to increase their grief, I calmed myself. →

That day and the next we did not speak a word.

66

O hard earth, why did you not engulf us?



‘When we had come as far as the fourth day

my Gaddo threw himself on the ground before me,

69

crying, “O father, why won’t you help me?”



‘There he died; and even as you see me now

I watched the other three die, one by one,

72

on the fifth day and the sixth. And I began,



‘already blind, to grope over their bodies,

and for two days called to them, though they were dead. →

75

Then fasting had more power than grief.’ →



Having said this, with maddened eyes he seized →

that wretched skull again between his teeth

78

and clenched them on the bone just like a dog.



Ah Pisa, how you shame the people →

of that fair land where ‘sì’ is heard!

81

Since your neighbors are so slow to punish you,



may the islands of Capraia and Gorgona

move in to block the Arno at its mouth

84

and so drown every living soul in you!



Even if Count Ugolino bore the name

of traitor to your castles, you still

87

should not have put his children to such torture.



Their tender years, you modern Thebes,

made Uguiccione and Brigata innocent,

90

and the other two this canto names above.



We went on farther, to where the ice-crust →

rudely wraps another sort of souls,

93

their faces not turned down but up.



The very weeping there prevents their weeping, →

for the grief that meets a barrier at the eyelids

96

turns inward to augment their anguish,



since their first tears become a crust

that like a crystal visor fills

99

the cups beneath the eyebrows.



Although the cold had made →

all feeling leave my face

102

as though it were a callus,



I still could feel a breath of wind.

And I said: ‘Master, who sets this in motion?

105

Are not all winds banished here below?’



Thus he to me: ‘You will come soon enough →

to where your eyes will give an answer,

108

seeing the source that puts out such a blast.’



And one of the wretches in the icy crust →

cried out: ‘O souls, so hard of heart

111

you are assigned the lowest station,



‘lift from my face these rigid veils

so I can vent a while the grief that swells

114

my heart, until my tears freeze up again.’



‘If you want my help, let me know your name,’ →

I answered. ‘Then, if I do not relieve you,

117

may I have to travel to the bottom of the ice.’



He spoke: ‘I am Fra Alberigo. I am he →

who harvested the evil orchard,

120

and here, for figs, I am repaid in dates.’



‘Oh,’ said I to him, ‘are you already dead?’

And he to me: ‘I have no knowledge →

123

how my body fares in the world above.



‘Such privilege has this Ptolomea,

that many times a soul may fall down here

126

well before Atropos has cut it loose.



‘So that you may be all the more inclined

to scrape these tear-drops glazed upon my face,

129

know that the moment when a soul betrays



‘as I did, its body is taken by a devil,

who has it then in his control

132

until the time allotted it has run.



‘The soul falls headlong to this cesspool.

Perhaps the body of this shade, who spends →

135

the winter with me here, still walks the earth,



‘as you must know, if you’ve come down just now.

He is Branca d’Oria. Quite some years

138

have passed since he was thus confined.’



‘I think,’ I said to him, ‘you’re fooling me.

For Branca d’Oria is not yet dead: he eats

141

and drinks and sleeps and puts on clothes.’



‘In the ditch above, of the Malebranche,’

he said, ‘where the clingy pitch is at the boil,

144

Michel Zanche had not yet arrived



‘when this man left a devil in his stead

to own his body, as did his kinsman,

147

his partner in the treacherous act.



‘But now extend your hand and open →

my eyes for me.’ I did not open them.

150

And to be rude to him was courtesy.



O men of Genoa, race estranged →

from every virtue, crammed with every vice,

153

why have you not been driven from the earth?



With the most heinous spirit of Romagna

I found a son of yours who, for his evil deeds,

even now in Cocytus bathes his soul

157

while yet his body moves among the living.

INFERNO XXXIV


‘Vexilla regis produent inferno →

toward us. Look straight before you

3

and see if you can make him out,’ my master said.



As when a thick mist rises, or when our hemisphere →

darkens to night, one may discern

6

a distant windmill by its turning sails,



it seemed to me I saw such a contrivance.

And, to avoid the wind, I drew in close →

9

behind my leader: there was nowhere else to hide.



Now—and I shudder as I write it out in verse— →

I was where the shades were wholly covered, →

12

showing through like bits of straw in glass.



Some are lying down, still others stand erect: →

some with their heads, and some with their footsoles, up,

15

some bent like bows, their faces to their toes.



When we had gotten far enough along

that my master was pleased to let me see

18

the creature who was once so fair of face,



he took a step aside, then brought me to a halt:

‘Look there at Dis! And see the place →

21

where you must arm yourself with fortitude.



Then how faint and frozen I became,’ →

reader, do not ask, for I do not write it,

24

since any words would fail to be enough.



I did not die, nor did I stay alive.

Imagine, if you have the wit,

27

what I became, deprived of either state.



The emperor of the woeful kingdom

rose from the ice below his breast,

30

and I in size am closer to a giant →



than giants are when measured to his arms.

Judge, then, what the whole must be

33

that is proportional to such a part.



If he was fair as he is hideous now,

and raised his brow in scorn of his creator, →

36

he is fit to be the source of every sorrow.



Oh, what a wonder it appeared to me →

when I perceived three faces on his head.

39

The first, in front, was red in color. →



Another two he had, each joined with this,

above the midpoint of each shoulder,

42

and all the three united at the crest.



The one on the right was a whitish yellow,

while the left-hand one was tinted like the people

45

living at the sources of the Nile.



Beneath each face two mighty wings emerged, →

such as befit so vast a bird:

48

I never saw such massive sails at sea.



They were featherless and fashioned

like a bat’s wings. When he flapped them,

51

he sent forth three separate winds,



the sources of the ice upon Cocytus.

Out of six eyes he wept and his three chins →

54

dripped tears and drooled blood-red saliva.



With his teeth, just like a hackle

pounding flax, he champed a sinner

57

in each mouth, tormenting three at once.



For the one in front the gnawing was a trifle

to the clawing, for from time to time

60

his back was left with not a shred of skin.



‘That soul up there who bears the greatest pain,’ →

said the master, ‘is Judas Iscariot, who has

63

his head within and outside flails his legs.



‘As for the other two, whose heads are dangling down,

Brutus is hanging from the swarthy snout—

66

see how he writhes and utters not a word!—



‘and from the other, Cassius, so large of limb.

But night is rising in the sky. It is time →

69

for us to leave, for we have seen it all.’



At his request I clasped him round the neck.

When the wings had opened wide enough →

72

he chose the proper time and place



and took a handhold on those hairy flanks.

Then from hank to hank he clambered down

75

between the thick pelt and the crusted ice.



When we had come to where the thighbone →

swivels, at the broad part of the hips,

78

my leader, with much strain of limb and breath,



turned his head where Satan had his shanks

and clung to the hair like a man climbing upward,

81

so that I thought we were heading back to Hell.



‘Hold on tight, for by such rungs as these,’

said my master, panting like a man exhausted,

84

‘must we depart from so much evil.’



Then out through an opening in the rock he went,

setting me down upon its edge to rest.

87

And then, with quick and cautious steps, he joined me.



I raised my eyes, thinking I would see

Lucifer still the same as I had left him,

90

but saw him with his legs held upward.



And if I became confused, let those dull minds

who fail to see what point I’d passed

93

comprehend what I felt then.



The master said to me: ‘Get to your feet, →

for the way is long and the road not easy,

96

and the sun returns to middle tierce.’



It was not the great hall of a palace, →

where we were, but a natural dungeon,

99

rough underfoot and wanting light.



‘Master, before I tear myself from this abyss,’

I said once I had risen,

102

‘say a few words to rid me of my doubt.



‘Where is the ice? Why is this one fixed now

upside down? And how in so few hours

105

has the sun moved from evening into morning?’



And he to me: ‘You imagine you are still

beyond the center, where I grasped the hair

108

of the guilty worm by whom the world is pierced.



‘So you were, as long as I descended,

but, when I turned around, you passed the point

111

to which all weights are drawn from every side.



‘You are now beneath the hemisphere

opposite the one that canopies the landmass—

114

and underneath its zenith that Man was slain



‘who without sin was born and sinless lived.

You have your feet upon a little sphere

117

that forms Judecca’s other face.



‘Here it is morning when it is evening there,

and the one whose hair provided us a ladder

120

is fixed exactly as he was before.



‘It was on this side that he fell from Heaven. →

And the dry land that used to stand, above,

123

in fear of him immersed itself in water



‘and fled into our hemisphere. And perhaps

to escape from him the land we’ll find above

126

created this lacuna when it rushed back up.’



As far as one can get from Beelzebub, →

in the remotest corner of this cavern,

129

there is a place one cannot find by sight,



but by the sound of a narrow stream that trickles

through a channel it has cut into the rock

132

in its meanderings, making a gentle slope.



Into that hidden passage my guide and I →

entered, to find again the world of light,

135

and, without thinking of a moment’s rest,



we climbed up, he first and I behind him,

far enough to see, through a round opening,

a few of those fair things the heavens bear.

139

Then we came forth, to see again the stars.
